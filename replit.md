# SSELFIE Studio

## Overview
SSELFIE Studio is an AI-powered personal branding platform designed to transform selfies into professional brand photos. It features two primary AI personalities, Maya (AI photographer) and Victoria (AI strategist), supported by a sophisticated multi-agent AI system. The platform aims to provide users with professional-grade personal branding assets by integrating advanced AI services for image generation and conversational interactions, targeting the personal branding and professional imaging market.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **Routing**: Wouter.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query.
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS.
- **Design System**: Luxury editorial theme, Times New Roman typography, sophisticated color palette.
- **Component Organization**: Feature-based structure.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Authentication**: Passport.js (local and Google OAuth), session-based.
- **Agent System**: Multi-agent architecture coordinating 13+ specialized AI agents. Hybrid routing for AI integration.
- **File Operations**: Direct repository access for admin agents using specialized tools (`str_replace_based_edit_tool`, `bash`).

### Data Architecture
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript schema definitions.
- **User Management**: Comprehensive user profiles, subscription tiers, onboarding data, brand preferences.
- **Conversation System**: Claude conversations and messages with agent-specific routing and memory management.
- **Image Storage**: AWS S3 for training images and generated content.

### Agent System Design
- **Admin Agents**: Full repository access and file modification.
- **Member Agents**: Secure, limited-access for guided user experiences.
- **Tool Integration**: Access to filesystem tools, bash commands, web search.
- **Security Separation**: Role-based access control.
- **Memory System**: Consolidated single memory service (simple-memory-service.ts) with 12-hour cache duration, database persistence, and reformed verification system. Eliminates memory conflicts that previously made admin agents unusable. Implemented August 9, 2025 via Olga's consolidation plan.
- **Verification-First Training**: All agents are trained to verify information using tools before making claims, ensuring evidence-based responses and actions.
- **Elena Workflow Execution Fix**: Added execution protocols alongside analysis capabilities. Elena now has three distinct modes: Analysis Protocol (audits/analysis), Execution Protocol (build/implement requests), and Coordination Protocol (multi-agent workflows). Resolves issue where Elena defaulted to analysis instead of executing workflows. Fixed August 10, 2025.
- **Elena Agent System Understanding Fix**: Clarified separation between Member Agents (Maya/Victoria - limited capabilities for user experience) vs Admin Agents (14 consulting agents with full capabilities for business management). Prevents Elena from confusing or attempting to modify protected member agent personalities. Fixed August 10, 2025.
- **Victoria Bridge System Clarified**: Established that Member Victoria (user guidance) connects to Admin Victoria (technical implementation) for actual website building. Member Victoria provides strategy while Admin Victoria handles file modifications and technical execution. Fixed August 10, 2025.
- **Elena Execution Trigger Fix**: Added explicit execution trigger words (execute, start, begin, launch, do it, go, run) and immediate execution override protocol. Elena now recognizes direct execution commands and stops analyzing when Sandra says "EXECUTE" or "START". Fixed August 10, 2025.
- **Elena Execution Simplification**: Removed approval-seeking patterns, complex completion signatures, and conversational restrictions that blocked immediate execution. Simplified execution protocol to: assign immediately, report actions not plans, no permission asking. Elena now executes directly without "let me analyze first" responses. Fixed August 10, 2025.
- **Agent Intelligence Optimization**: Removed "work mode vs test mode" confusion from ZARA that was creating hesitation about when to act. All agents now have clean, direct action protocols without cognitive barriers blocking their natural intelligence. Fixed August 10, 2025.
- **Elena Coordination Theater Resolution**: Built agent-coordination-tool.ts bridge connecting Elena to existing MultiAgentCoordinator and IntelligentTaskDistributor systems. Added coordinate_agents tool to Elena's capabilities and explicit instructions to use tool instead of making announcements. Elena now executes real agent coordination instead of "coordination theater." Fixed August 10, 2025.
