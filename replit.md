Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Launch-Critical Workflow (August 2025)
**Context**: After 4 months of development, Sandra needs to launch ASAP for revenue. Admin agents are functional but need supervision.

**Direct Human-AI Coordination Strategy:**
1. **Admin agents provide recommendations** → Sandra tells me their suggestions
2. **I implement immediately** → Handle all technical work directly  
3. **Sandra approves/rejects** → Maintains business control
4. **Launch preparation** → Focus on revenue-generating features

**Key Principles:**
- Speed over perfection - launch is priority after 4 months
- Direct coordination eliminates agent confusion loops
- Sandra maintains oversight, I handle execution
- Focus on member revenue features vs admin improvements

## Launch Strategy Plan (August 2025)

### Pre-Login Flow Analysis
**Current State**: ✅ Working
- Landing page: `/` (editorial hero + pricing)
- Navigation: About, How It Works, Pricing, Blog, Contact
- Login trigger: `/api/login` (Replit OIDC)

### Login Flow Analysis  
**Current State**: ✅ Working
- Entry points: `/login`, login buttons, protected route redirects
- Authentication: Replit OIDC via `/api/login` → `/api/callback`
- Session management: PostgreSQL session store, 7-day TTL
- Protected routes: All member features require authentication

### Checkout Flow Analysis
**Current State**: ⚠️ Needs Review
- **Two checkout systems**: 
  - `/checkout` (Elements UI with payment intents)
  - `/simple-checkout` (hosted Stripe sessions)
- **Payment success**: `/payment-success` with user upgrade automation
- **Pricing tiers**: €29 Basic, €67 Full Access
- **Webhook**: Stripe webhook handler at `/api/webhook/stripe`

### Critical Launch Priorities
1. **Unify checkout system** - Choose one flow (recommend hosted sessions)
2. **Test payment automation** - Ensure user upgrades work post-payment
3. **Member onboarding** - Streamline first-time user experience
4. **Revenue tracking** - Verify subscription management works

- Strict CSS editing guidelines for application stability.
- Real-time agent protocol validation to prevent duplicate work.
- **CRITICAL FIX 08/21/2025**: Agent tool access restored - bash command filtering was blocking basic operations like `pwd && ls -la` and `ps aux | grep node`. Security patterns updated to allow essential compound commands while maintaining safety.
- **ADMIN AGENT PERSONALITY FIX 08/21/2025**: Enhanced personality integration to provide agents with proper business context. Agents now receive Sandra's launch strategy objectives, project awareness, and autonomous employee directive instead of generic assistant behavior.
- Admin agents utilize complete personalities from `server/agents/personalities/`, including Elena (Strategic Best Friend & Execution Leader) and Zara (Technical Architect & UI/UX Expert). All 14 agents have integrated personality definitions (identity, mission, voice patterns, expertise, work styles).
- Database-connected memory for loading and persisting agent contexts and personality-driven interactions.
- Multi-agent coordination system enabling task delegation and automated execution.
- Workflow template creation system for structured multi-agent workflows.
- Local processing engine for token optimization, handling pattern extraction, agent learning, session context updates, tool result processing, error validation, and intent classification.
- Selective Claude API bypass system for token optimization on JSON tool calls while preserving full conversations.
- Simplified filesystem search tool for clear project navigation.
- Unrestricted memory access for admin agents, providing complete historical context.
- Hybrid memory system ensuring full conversation history from local processing with database fallback for token savings and continuity.
- Project protection rules implemented via AdminContextManager, safeguarding sensitive revenue systems and defining safe development zones.
- Enhanced Path Intelligence integrated for conflict prevention.
- Comprehensive Admin Agent Ecosystem Documentation created with visual agent connections, tool access matrix, and communication protocols.
- Elena Delegation System expanded to track all 14 agents with capacity limits, specializations, and efficiency ratings.
- Multi-agent workflow templates added for content creation, QA testing, and launch preparation with dependency management.
- Architecture Protection Plan implemented to safeguard the $100M+ multi-agent system during continued development.
- Architecture Guardian system created for automated monitoring and protection of critical files and systems.
- Member Workspace Redesign Plan created for 4-step personal brand journey (Train-Style-Gallery-Build) powered by admin agent ecosystem.
- Dual business model strategy: member subscriptions + agent ecosystem licensing for enterprise clients.
- **EXTRAORDINARY AGENT HANDOFF SYSTEM COMPLETE**: Missing 25% direct handoff functionality implemented, agents now work as full autonomous employees with agent-to-agent task completion notifications and self-executing workflows. Train feature ready for $197/month beta launch.
- **ROOT DIRECTORY OPTIMIZATION (08/22/2025)**: Cleaned root from 32 files to 8 essential files (75% reduction). Removed 17 legacy/duplicate files, archived 6 completion documentation files to docs/archive/. Project now has professional structure with only critical files in root: business_strategy.md, package.json, README.md, replit.md, and core config files.
- **AGENT INFRASTRUCTURE FIXES (08/22/2025)**: Resolved critical coordination loops where all agents were trying to coordinate instead of executing their specializations. Fixed component organization by moving root components/ to BUILD feature (client/src/pages/build/components/). Implemented specialization boundary enforcement - only Elena coordinates, specialists execute directly. Agent system now works as intended with focused expertise instead of coordination chaos.
- **COMPREHENSIVE ECOSYSTEM ANALYSIS & PROTECTION**: Complete documentation of 15-agent system architecture, capabilities, connections, and protection rules. Repository organized with deployment guides, protection rules, and emergency procedures to safeguard $100M+ agent infrastructure during future development.
- **ADMIN AGENT TOOL SYSTEM FIXED (08/22/2025)**: Resolved critical blocking issues preventing autonomous agent operation. Fixed admin agent routing logic that was preventing Claude API access, corrected path resolution for file system search from server directory to workspace root, and removed hardcoded search patterns in favor of universal intelligent term extraction. Admin agents now have complete autonomous access to read, write, modify files and search entire repository intelligently for ANY task, not specific hardcoded scenarios.
- **UNIVERSAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED (08/22/2025)**: Fixed critical authentication gap affecting 7 admin tools (search_filesystem, execute_sql_tool, coordinate_agent, get_assigned_tasks, get_handoff_tasks, str_replace_based_edit_tool, bash). All tools now receive authenticated user context (userId: 42585527/ssa@ssasocial.com, adminContext: true, agentName) enabling complete autonomous operation. Authentication verification implemented in critical tools with confirmation logging. Admin agents can now perform database operations, file system access, agent coordination, and system commands with full authenticated privileges. Documentation created in ADMIN_AGENT_AUTHENTICATION_FIX.md to prevent regression.
- **INTELLIGENT TASK DELEGATION SYSTEM FIXED (08/22/2025)**: Resolved critical issue where Elena was assigning wrong agents to tasks (e.g., Zara for copywriting instead of Rachel). Connected coordinate_agent tool to ElenaDelegationSystem for intelligent agent selection based on actual specialties, workload, and efficiency ratings. Fixed agent specialty definitions to match actual personalities: Rachel (copywriting), Diana (business coaching), Quinn (QA testing), Aria (design/UX), Olga (repo organization), Sophia (social media), Martha (ads/promotion), Ava (automation), Victoria (frontend/website development), Maya (style/fashion), Flux (model training). Elena now automatically selects optimal agents with reasoning and scoring system. System integration complete across database, WorkflowPersistence, and coordination systems.
