# SSELFIE Studio - AI Personal Branding Platform

## Overview
SSELFIE Studio is Sandra's AI personal branding platform designed to simplify personal branding by generating unlimited professional brand photos using AI, replacing traditional photoshoots. It operates with a core TRAIN → STYLE → GALLERY workflow. The platform targets women entrepreneurs with a $47/month subscription, aiming for an initial launch MRR of $2,350 by leveraging an existing large follower base. The long-term vision includes scaling this success and potentially selling the underlying admin agent ecosystem to enterprises, with strategic plans for future market expansion while maintaining the core brand identity.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Preferences: Keep technical controls hidden - users prefer Maya to handle technical details automatically rather than exposing preset/seed parameters.
PROJECT STATUS: LAUNCH READY - Simplified to core TRAIN → STYLE → GALLERY flow for immediate €47/month launch. Maya authentication cleaned for production - development access removed for professional launch experience.

- Local processing engine for token optimization, handling pattern extraction, session context updates, and intent classification.
- Selective Claude API bypass for token optimization on JSON tool calls while preserving full conversations.
- Project protection rules via `AdminContextManager` safeguard sensitive revenue systems and define safe development zones.
- Enhanced Path Intelligence prevents conflicts.
- An "Extraordinary Agent Handoff System" enables autonomous agent-to-agent task completion.
- A "Comprehensive Ecosystem Analysis & Protection" framework documents the multi-agent system's architecture, capabilities, and protection rules.
- The Maya system provides a 6-step discovery flow (Welcome → Current Situation → Future Vision → Business Context → Style Discovery → Photo Goals) and seamlessly transitions to personality-driven chat and image generation. Intelligent Quick Actions generate contextual suggestions, replacing generic templated buttons. A Welcome page offers "CUSTOMIZE" (guided onboarding) or "QUICK START" (immediate photo generation) options.
- Category-aware styling system ensures Maya's AI adapts presets based on detected categories from user requests (e.g., Business, Lifestyle, Travel).
- **Creative Freedom Liberation (August 29, 2025)**: Identified and removed the critical hardcoded "REQUIRED STRUCTURE" template in createDetailedPromptFromConcept function that was forcing Maya into rigid formatting patterns and overriding her AI creativity. Replaced constraining numbered structure (1. STYLING INTELLIGENCE, 2. POSE & EXPRESSION, etc.) with natural creative freedom instructions that let Maya express her full personality and expertise without rigid templates. This allows Maya to generate unique, unexpected styling combinations instead of repetitive, boring outfits.
- **Anatomy Intelligence Liberation (August 29, 2025)**: Removed forceful anatomy keyword injection that was contaminating Maya's creative prompts. Replaced rigid "perfect hands, well-defined fingers" requirements with natural pose guidance, allowing Maya's styling intelligence to choose appropriate gestures and positioning organically within her creative vision. This prevents anatomy keywords from overwhelming styling descriptions and allows Maya to generate complete fashion concepts instead of hand-focused images.
- **Conversational Contamination Fix (August 29, 2025)**: Fixed critical issue where Maya's conversational responses ("Oh honey, I'm getting MAJOR elevated energy...") were being included in Replicate prompts, contaminating image generation. Completely redesigned cleanMayaPrompt function to use minimal cleaning that preserves Maya's complete creative styling content while removing only obvious conversation markers. Eliminated aggressive prompt stripping that was removing Maya's creative fashion descriptions. This ensures Maya's styling intelligence flows through to image generation while removing chat formatting.
- **Portrait Hardcoding Liberation (August 29, 2025)**: Identified and removed the critical hardcoded portrait restrictions that were forcing Maya to only generate close-up portraits. Completely rewrote the shot type detection logic to prioritize full-body and dynamic shots over static portraits. Updated Maya's creative instructions to explicitly grant her freedom to choose between full-body, half-body, and close-up shots based on the concept. Enhanced prompt extraction patterns to recognize environmental, pose, and lifestyle terminology. Changed the default shot type from "halfBodyShot" to "fullScenery" to encourage dynamic, interesting compositions. Maya now has complete creative freedom to generate the shot type that best serves each concept.
- **Conversation Contamination Critical Fix (August 29, 2025)**: Discovered Maya's complete conversational responses were still contaminating FLUX prompts despite previous fixes. Enhanced cleanMayaPrompt with aggressive conversation removal targeting asterisk-wrapped content, Maya's excited expressions, and style commentary. Removed hardcoded seed violation and restored dynamic seed generation. Maya's styling intelligence now flows cleanly to image generation without conversational contamination while maintaining anti-hardcoding policy compliance.
- **Split Image Prevention System (August 29, 2025)**: Added comprehensive restrictions to prevent Maya from generating split transformation diptych, before/after, or comparison images. Updated Maya's personality to remove transformation journey language that could trigger split compositions. Enhanced prompt cleaning to strip transformation and comparison terminology. Maya now generates only single, cohesive images showing one complete styling moment without split screen elements.
- **FLUX 1.1 Pro Research Optimization (August 29, 2025)**: Implemented research-backed prompt optimization based on 2025 FLUX best practices. Added intelligent duplicate detection to prevent technical tag duplication that was causing quality loss. Enhanced conversational cleaning with specific pattern removal for Maya's energy introductions ("major 'concept' energy let me create something"). Added anatomy keywords ("beautiful hands, detailed fingers") early in prompts for improved hand quality. Restructured prompt assembly to follow research-optimal order: [TRIGGER] → [TECHNICAL_PREFIX] → [ANATOMY_KEYWORDS] → [CLEANED_MAYA_STYLING]. Maya's personality updated to output natural language styling descriptions without technical tags, eliminating contamination issues. Updated guidance_scale from 3.5 to 5.0 across all shot types for stronger prompt adherence and better anatomical accuracy based on research findings that 5.0-7.0 range improves anatomy-critical image generation.
- **Context Preservation Fix (August 29, 2025)**: Fixed critical inconsistency issue where Maya's original styling context was being ignored during prompt generation. Modified createDetailedPromptFromConcept to use Maya's original context instead of creating new concepts, ensuring perfect consistency between concept card descriptions and generated images. Maya now preserves her complete original styling intelligence, creative vision, and technical choices when users click concept cards.
- **Maya Gallery Save Fix (August 29, 2025)**: Fixed critical issue where images hearted in Maya's chat were not appearing in SSELFIE gallery. The heartImageToGallery function was saving images to database but missing isSelected and isFavorite flags required by gallery retrieval logic. Added proper flags so hearted images from Maya's chat now correctly appear in user's SSELFIE gallery.
- **Maya Historical Concept Cards Fix (August 29, 2025)**: Fixed critical issue where previous Maya chat sessions displayed raw JSON instead of rendered concept cards. Enhanced Maya chat messages database schema with dedicated conceptCards, quickButtons, and canGenerate fields. Updated storage logic to save concept cards separately from content and enhanced retrieval to properly parse JSON fields for frontend compatibility. Historical conversations now correctly display interactive concept cards instead of code.
- **Maya Editorial Style Audit & Upgrades (August 29, 2025)**: Conducted comprehensive audit of Maya page against editorial style guide and implemented sophisticated design upgrades. Enhanced chat header with editorial eyebrow text and Times New Roman typography. Upgraded welcome state with larger Maya avatar, hover effects, and improved spacing. Enhanced input area with better focus states, typography, and editorial button design. Added interactive progressive session loading to replace static "more sessions" text. Fixed Maya Claude API connection by updating incorrect model name from 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514' to 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'. Maya interface now fully matches editorial style guide with elegant hover animations and professional typography.
- **Maya Pipeline Optimization Complete (August 30, 2025)**: Successfully completed Phase 2 pipeline optimization connecting Maya's styling intelligence directly to image generation. Enhanced createDetailedPromptFromConcept function with category-aware styling that uses Maya's 19 categories and 5 styling approaches each. Added intelligent category detection from user context (Business, Lifestyle, Casual, Travel, Instagram). Cleaned up redundant code and fixed LSP errors. Comprehensive testing confirms Maya's specific styling descriptions now flow from personality file through to FLUX prompts, eliminating generic fallbacks. All 19 categories generate unique, professional styling approaches. End-to-end pipeline working with successful prediction generation for all test categories.
