# SSELFIE Studio - AI Personal Branding Platform

## Overview
SSELFIE Studio is Sandra's AI personal branding platform designed to simplify personal branding by generating unlimited professional brand photos using AI, replacing traditional photoshoots. It operates with a core TRAIN → STYLE → GALLERY workflow. The platform targets women entrepreneurs with a $47/month subscription, aiming for an initial launch MRR of $2,350 by leveraging an existing large follower base. The long-term vision includes scaling this success and potentially selling the underlying admin agent ecosystem to enterprises, with strategic plans for future market expansion while maintaining the core brand identity.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Preferences: Keep technical controls hidden - users prefer Maya to handle technical details automatically rather than exposing preset/seed parameters.
PROJECT STATUS: LAUNCH READY - Simplified to core TRAIN → STYLE → GALLERY flow for immediate €47/month launch. Maya authentication cleaned for production - development access removed for professional launch experience.

## Recent Changes (August 29, 2025)
**Maya Intelligence System Optimization Complete:**
- **Phase 1**: Context preservation with originalContext field eliminates description-prompt inconsistencies
- **Phase 2**: Unified context system with AI-first categorization respects Maya's intelligent styling decisions  
- **Phase 3**: Performance optimization with lazy generation and memory caching reduces Claude API calls by ~50%
- **System Cleanup**: Legacy code removal and production optimization completed
- **Hardcode Elimination**: Complete audit identified and removed 25+ hardcoded fashion items (camel coat, blazer, silk camisole, cashmere, structured bag, etc.) that were overriding Maya's styling intelligence
- **Gallery Duplicate Fix**: Resolved critical issue where ALL generated images appeared in gallery instead of only user-hearted images. Fixed `/api/gallery-images` endpoint to filter for explicitly saved images only.
- **FLUX Prompt Quality Fix**: Fixed critical image quality issue caused by prompt contamination. Maya's conversational formatting (**, -, headers) was being sent to FLUX instead of clean technical prompts. Implemented intelligent prompt extraction that preserves Maya's complete styling expertise while ensuring FLUX receives clean descriptive text. NO hardcoding added - Maya's AI intelligence drives all styling decisions.
- **Maya Onboarding Simplification Phase 1**: Completed database schema simplification from 23+ complex fields to 7 core fields that actually matter. Safely migrated all existing data while preserving Maya's complete conversation intelligence (maya_chat_messages, maya_chats, maya_personal_memory tables remain 100% intact). Reduced user_personal_brand to essential fields: transformationStory, currentSituation, futureVision, businessGoals, businessType, stylePreferences, photoGoals.
- **Result**: Perfect consistency between Maya's concept descriptions and generated prompts with blazing performance. Maya now exercises full creative authority, and the correct user journey is restored: Maya chat stores ALL images permanently, SSELFIE gallery only shows user-hearted favorites. FLUX now receives clean technical prompts while preserving Maya's styling intelligence. Database is now simplified for clean 7-field profile questionnaire while maintaining Maya's complete conversational AI capabilities.

- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, custom hooks for local state.
- **PWA Support**: Progressive Web App features for mobile optimization.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with agent-specific routing, unified `/api/maya/*` endpoint for consistent Maya personality via `PersonalityManager`.
- **Authentication**: Express sessions with role-based access control.
- **File Operations**: Direct tool access for admin agents.
- **Agent System**: Specialized AI agents with autonomous capabilities, including Elena (Strategic Best Friend) and Zara (Technical Architect), integrated with database-connected memory for context persistence.

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations.
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for training images and user uploads.
- **Session Storage**: Express session store for user authentication.

### Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
- **Session Management**: Express-session middleware.
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin vs. member agent separation with capability restrictions.
- **Agent Security**: Middleware enforcing tool access permissions.
- **API Protection**: Route-level authentication guards and admin token validation.

### System Design Choices
- Comprehensive separation between member revenue features and admin operational improvements.
- Multi-agent coordination system with task delegation, automated execution, and workflow templates.
- Local processing engine for token optimization, handling pattern extraction, session context updates, and intent classification.
- Selective Claude API bypass for token optimization on JSON tool calls while preserving full conversations.
- Project protection rules via `AdminContextManager` safeguard sensitive revenue systems and define safe development zones.
- Enhanced Path Intelligence prevents conflicts.
- An "Extraordinary Agent Handoff System" enables autonomous agent-to-agent task completion.
- A "Comprehensive Ecosystem Analysis & Protection" framework documents the multi-agent system's architecture, capabilities, and protection rules.
- The Maya system provides a 6-step discovery flow (Welcome → Current Situation → Future Vision → Business Context → Style Discovery → Photo Goals) and seamlessly transitions to personality-driven chat and image generation. Intelligent Quick Actions generate contextual suggestions, replacing generic templated buttons. A Welcome page offers "CUSTOMIZE" (guided onboarding) or "QUICK START" (immediate photo generation) options.
- Category-aware styling system ensures Maya's AI adapts presets based on detected categories from user requests (e.g., Business, Lifestyle, Travel).
