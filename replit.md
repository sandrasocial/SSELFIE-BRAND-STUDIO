# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built using React with TypeScript, featuring a luxury design system centered on Times New Roman typography and sophisticated black/white/gray color palettes. It uses Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling with luxury design tokens. Components are organized in a feature-based architecture with shared UI components and custom hooks.

## Backend Architecture
The server is built on Express.js with TypeScript, implementing a RESTful API architecture. It uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database operations and PassportJS for authentication. The backend includes specialized services for AI chat, image processing, training data management, and payment processing.

## Agent System Architecture
A unique multi-agent system coordinates AI assistants through a unified communication layer. Each agent has specialized capabilities (e.g., Maya for photography, Victoria for websites) and communicates via consolidated endpoints at `/api/consulting-agents/`. The system uses singleton Claude service instances for performance and maintains consistent data storage in `claudeConversations`/`claudeMessages` tables. Agents have full enterprise tool access, including file operations and code generation.

**AGENT PERSONALITY CONTEXT RESTORATION (August 6, 2025):** Fixed critical context loss causing generic agent responses. Integrated AdvancedMemorySystem and IntelligentContextManager into Claude API service to restore agent personalities, specialized voices, and learning continuity while maintaining function calling capabilities.

## Data Storage Solutions
PostgreSQL serves as the primary database with schemas for users, conversations, training data, and agent interactions. AWS S3 is used for storing training images and generated content. Local file storage is used for flatlay collections and brand assets, with efficient caching.

## Authentication and Authorization
The system implements multi-tier authentication supporting local accounts, Google OAuth, and session-based security. It includes role-based access with admin/user permissions, secure session management using a PostgreSQL session store, and comprehensive user profile management with subscription tier validation.
