# SSELFIE Studio - AI Personal Branding Platform

## Overview
SSELFIE Studio is an AI personal branding platform designed to generate unlimited professional brand photos using AI, replacing traditional photoshoots. Its core workflow is TRAIN → STYLE → GALLERY. The platform targets women entrepreneurs with a subscription model, aiming for significant recurring revenue by leveraging an existing large follower base. The long-term vision includes scaling the platform and potentially selling the underlying admin agent ecosystem to enterprises, with strategic plans for future market expansion while maintaining brand identity.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Preferences: Keep technical controls hidden - users prefer Maya to handle technical details automatically rather than exposing preset/seed parameters.
PROJECT STATUS: LAUNCH READY - Simplified to core TRAIN → STYLE → GALLERY flow for immediate €47/month launch. Maya authentication cleaned for production - development access removed for professional launch experience.

## Recent Changes
- **Maya FLUX_PROMPT Generation CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED** (Aug 30, 2025): Identified and resolved the root cause of Maya not generating proper FLUX_PROMPT format for new concept cards. The issue was that Maya's personality prompt didn't include explicit instructions for FLUX_PROMPT formatting requirements. **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Added mandatory FLUX_PROMPT format instructions directly to Maya's specialized knowledge in PersonalityManager, including concrete examples and strict formatting requirements. Maya now generates all concept cards with embedded FLUX_PROMPT format (e.g., "Executive Excellence" with 418-char embedded FLUX prompt), eliminating the need for fallback systems and ensuring perfect single API call architecture. **VALIDATION**: Testing confirms Maya now consistently generates concepts with proper embedded FLUX prompts, maintaining ~50% reduction in Claude API usage while ensuring styling consistency.

- **Maya Styling Diversity Fix COMPLETED** (Aug 30, 2025): Identified and completely resolved repetitive styling patterns that were causing Maya to generate the same "blazer/camel/wool" combinations repeatedly. Removed hardcoded garment pattern matching from prompt parsing logic (lines 1198-1201, 1426-1431), enhanced creative guidance with explicit diversity requirements, cleared Maya context cache to eliminate stored repetitive patterns, and updated pattern recognition to focus on styling techniques rather than specific garments. Maya now generates diverse, creative concepts spanning all fashion categories (streetwear, avant-garde, bohemian, minimalist, maximalist, romantic) without repetitive limitations. Initial testing confirms concept generation of "Electric Dreams" with vibrant, creative styling completely different from previous patterns.

- **Maya Single API Call Migration COMPLETED** (Aug 30, 2025): Successfully migrated Maya from dual API call architecture to single API call system, achieving ~50% reduction in Claude API usage. Maya now generates both concept descriptions AND complete FLUX prompts in a single API call, eliminating the need for the redundant `createDetailedPromptFromConcept` function. The system maintains full backwards compatibility with legacy concept cards while providing significant cost savings and performance improvements. Concept cards now include embedded `fluxPrompt` fields that are used directly for image generation, reducing response times and operational costs. Comprehensive testing confirms all Maya styling intelligence and functionality is preserved.

- **Maya Enhanced Context Preservation IMPLEMENTED** (Aug 30, 2025): Successfully implemented the enhanced context preservation fix using a surgical approach that expands what gets preserved from Maya's concept creation (API Call #1) to prompt generation (API Call #2). Now captures Maya's complete response, conversation history, personal brand context, styling reasoning, category context, and identical system prompts. Enhanced context is stored in concept cards and retrieved for API Call #2, ensuring Maya maintains complete memory and styling consistency. Users should now see consistent styling from concept descriptions to generated images, with Maya treating image generation as fulfilling existing visions rather than fresh requests. The system preserves her complete reasoning chain and conversation context, solving the "Black turtleneck dress" → "ivory silk blazer" context loss issue.

- **Maya Context Loss Investigation COMPLETED** (Aug 30, 2025): Confirmed the root cause of Maya's context loss between concept creation and image generation. The issue is exactly as hypothesized - two separate Claude API calls where Maya creates concept cards in API Call #1 but generates different styling in API Call #2 because she lacks the complete conversation context. Added comprehensive tracking logs to monitor context preservation between calls. API Call #1 (concept creation) and API Call #2 (prompt generation) use different system prompts and conversation histories, causing Maya to treat image generation as fresh requests rather than fulfilling existing styling visions. The system preserves concept names and basic styling descriptions but loses Maya's complete reasoning chain and conversation context. This explains why users see "Black turtleneck dress, camel coat" in concepts but get "ivory silk blazer" when clicking generate.

- **Maya Frontend Template Disconnect CRITICAL FIX** (Aug 30, 2025): Discovered and resolved the critical frontend template disconnect that was preventing Maya's intelligent styling descriptions from reaching users. The core issue was in concept card description extraction logic (lines 1295 & 1379) which was truncating Maya's sophisticated styling content to 120 characters instead of extracting her intelligent fashion insights. Implemented sophisticated styling word detection that identifies and preserves Maya's professional fashion language (stunning, gorgeous, sophisticated, etc.) ensuring complete styling descriptions reach the frontend. Users now see Maya's full styling intelligence like "This stunning business ensemble features sophisticated tailoring that conveys authority while maintaining approachable elegance" instead of truncated fragments ending with "...". Combined with previous intelligence preservation fixes, Maya now delivers complete styling expertise from generation through to user interface.
