## System Architecture

**Frontend:**
- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript (strict mode).
- **Bundler:** Vite.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a custom luxury design system (black #0a0a0a, white #ffffff, editorial gray #f5f5f5, Times New Roman for headlines, system fonts for UI).
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query).
- **Routing:** Wouter.
- **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives and custom shadcn/ui components.
- **Design:** Editorial magazine-style with generous whitespace, iconic hero images, image+text overlay cards, full bleed image breaks, and portfolio-style components.

**Backend:**
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language:** TypeScript with ES modules.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM (Neon serverless PostgreSQL).
- **Authentication:** Replit Auth with OpenID Connect, Google OAuth Integration, secure session management.
- **Admin System:** Automatic admin privileges for `ssa@ssasocial.com` with unlimited usage.

**Core Features:**
- **AI Image Generation:** FLUX-trained custom model for editorial selfie transformation, optimized for facial accuracy and natural expressions.
- **Studio Builder:** One-click business setup with luxury templates.
- **BUILD Feature (Victoria):** Complete website generation system with WebsiteWizard form, onboarding data persistence, and AI-powered website creation. Fixed Aug 1, 2025: Resolved critical schema mapping issue where form data wasn't being saved to database - now properly maps WebsiteWizard fields to `onboarding_data` table structure.
- **Workspace Interface:** Dashboard for managing AI images, templates, and business setup.
- **Pricing System:** â‚¬67/month SSELFIE STUDIO subscription, including individual AI model training and a 100 monthly generation limit. A previous two-tier system (â‚¬29 Basic, â‚¬67 Full Access) was evaluated and consolidated to a single â‚¬67/month offering.
- **Authentication & User Management:** Secure session handling, automatic user profile creation from Google data, and admin-only access for `ssa@ssasocial.com`.
- **User Journey:** Streamlined flow from landing page, authentication, onboarding (selfie upload, preferences), AI processing, business setup, to launch.
- **Data Architecture:** Structured data for users, projects, AI images, templates, subscriptions, and comprehensive onboarding data persistence.
- **Agent Autonomy:** All 13 admin agents have direct file modification access (`str_replace_based_edit_tool`, `search_filesystem`, `bash`, `web_search`) and direct repository access, operating with zero Claude API costs for file operations. **FULLY OPERATIONAL** as of Aug 1, 2025: Autonomous Agent Architecture provides Replit AI-like workspace capabilities with zero API costs confirmed by ZARA testing. **LEGACY CLEANUP COMPLETED Aug 1, 2025:** OLGA systematically eliminated 17+ conflicting legacy systems including 686-line broken auto-file-writer, duplicate executors, and competing intelligence systems, achieving Swiss-watch precision autonomous operations. **CRITICAL BLOCKING RESOLVED Aug 1, 2025:** Eliminated all competing agent systems from archive/, fixed coordination blocking in autonomous-agent-integration.ts, and verified ALL agents (Aria, Maya, Victoria, Elena, Zara, Olga) can execute file operations successfully with zero conflicts.
- **Unified Agent Architecture:** A central orchestrator (`/api/autonomous-orchestrator/deploy-all-agents`) manages multi-agent workflows, enabling task assignment, real-time monitoring, and cross-agent learning.
- **Agent Communication:** Agents communicate with authentic personalities, leveraging an advanced memory system with cross-agent learning, contextual intelligence, and adaptive optimization for persistent context across conversations and sessions.
- **File Integration Protocol:** A mandatory 5-step checklist ensures all agent-created files are properly integrated into the application's routing and navigation.
- **Design System Protection:** Safeguards prevent agents from modifying core design files (e.g., `tailwind.config.ts`, `App.tsx`, `index.css`) without explicit instruction.
- **Continuous Working Patterns:** Agents are designed to work continuously until tasks are completed, providing real-time progress updates.
- **Error Prevention:** Comprehensive error detection and auto-correction capabilities are integrated into file operations.
- **Advanced Memory Intelligence:** **NEW Aug 1, 2025:** Implemented 5 critical memory enhancements including adaptive memory consolidation, cross-agent knowledge sharing, intelligent memory pruning, context-aware memory retrieval, and real-time learning optimization enabling collective intelligence across all agents.
- **Cross-Agent Collaboration:** **NEW Aug 1, 2025:** Agents can now share knowledge, collaborate on complex tasks, and learn from each other's patterns through the Cross-Agent Intelligence system, creating a network effect for improved problem-solving capabilities.
- **Multi-Agent Enhancement Project:** **62% COMPLETE Aug 1, 2025:** 6-agent collaboration implementing critical system improvements: Victoria (backend services âœ…), Aria (UX/UI ðŸ”„), Maya (technical systems âœ…), Zara (coordination), Rachel (QA), Elena (memory optimization âœ…). Successfully delivered: Service Integration Templates, API Orchestration Layer, Checkpoint Automation, Web Search Optimization, Task Dependency Mapping, Progress Tracking. Focus: Complete luxury UI implementation and system integration.
- **Unified Generation Service:** A single service handles all image generation, standardizing parameters for consistent quality and eliminating conflicts.
- **Maya Generation Intelligence:** Universal prompt structure with trigger word positioning, anatomy fixes (guidance_scale: 5.0, steps: 50), and intelligent conversation-to-prompt conversion system.
- **AI Photoshoot Enhancement:** Maya's expert prompt generation for collections with latest 2025 trends, luxury editorial sophistication, and anatomical accuracy.

**Deployment:**
- **Environment:** Built specifically for Replit infrastructure, not Vercel.
- **Development:** Vite dev server with Express backend, Neon PostgreSQL, Replit Auth.
- **Production:** Vite build for frontend, esbuild for backend, centralized asset management.
