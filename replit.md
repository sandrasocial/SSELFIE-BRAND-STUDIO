All agents now operate autonomously without false error reports.
- **HYBRID SYSTEM RESTORED (Aug 1, 2025):** Successfully fixed critical regression where admin agents were creating empty files instead of working code. Resolved by: 1. Fixed claudeService import error in routes.ts (line 1773), 2. Fixed memory.confidence.toFixed error in claude-api-service.ts, 3. Added content detection routing debug logs. System now correctly routes content generation to Claude API (for actual working code) and tool operations to autonomous system. Verified with successful file creation of simple-success-test.tsx with 962 characters of complete React TypeScript component code.
- **ELENA COORDINATION FIX COMPLETE (Aug 1, 2025):** Fixed Elena's role violation where she was implementing code directly instead of coordinating agents. Removed file modification tools from Elena, updated system prompt to emphasize delegation-only role. Elena now properly assigns tasks to specialist agents (Aria for UI, Zara for backend, Maya for AI) instead of creating files herself. Agent specialization hierarchy restored.
