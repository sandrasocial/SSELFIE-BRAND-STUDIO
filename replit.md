- **ROOT CAUSE:** Database shows training_status: 'not_started' but user claims model is ready
- **VALIDATION BLOCKING:** Server blocks Maya AI generation at line 786 (userModel.trainingStatus !== 'completed')
- **GENERATION FAILURE:** No generation tracker created = no API calls = no images
- **DATABASE INCONSISTENCY:** model_name exists (43782722-selfie-lora) but no replicate_model_id

**Maya AI Generation Flow Analysis:**
1. User clicks "generate" in Maya chat interface
2. Frontend calls /api/maya-generate-images with prompt
3. Server validates user has completed trained model
4. Server returns 400 error: "AI model training not_started"
5. Frontend shows error, no generation tracker created
6. User sees "starting" but no actual generation happens
7. No images appear because generation never started

**Solution Required:** Verify if sandrajonna has trained model and fix database inconsistency
