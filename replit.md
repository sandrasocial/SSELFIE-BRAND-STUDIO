## Recent Changes
- **Maya Emoji Styling System FULLY OPERATIONAL** (Aug 30, 2025): Completed comprehensive emoji styling system implementation across the entire pipeline. Fixed frontend emoji stripping bug and updated Maya's concept creation prompt (API Call #1) to instruct her to include styling emojis in concept titles. Updated Maya's prompt generation system (API Call #2) with emoji interpretation instructions. Maya now uses specific emojis (‚ú®üí´üî•üåüüíéüåÖüè¢üíºüåäüëëüíÉüì∏üé¨) in concept titles to communicate styling approaches throughout the entire system - from concept creation through to FLUX prompt generation. The complete emoji-based styling intelligence now flows from Maya's initial concept cards to final image generation, ensuring consistent styling approaches based on her emoji-coded system.

- **Maya Enhanced Context Preservation IMPLEMENTED** (Aug 30, 2025): Successfully implemented the enhanced context preservation fix using a surgical approach that expands what gets preserved from Maya's concept creation (API Call #1) to prompt generation (API Call #2). Now captures Maya's complete response, conversation history, personal brand context, styling reasoning, category context, and identical system prompts. Enhanced context is stored in concept cards and retrieved for API Call #2, ensuring Maya maintains complete memory and styling consistency. Users should now see consistent styling from concept descriptions to generated images, with Maya treating image generation as fulfilling existing visions rather than fresh requests. The system preserves her complete reasoning chain and conversation context, solving the "Black turtleneck dress" ‚Üí "ivory silk blazer" context loss issue.

- **Maya Context Loss Investigation COMPLETED** (Aug 30, 2025): Confirmed the root cause of Maya's context loss between concept creation and image generation. The issue is exactly as hypothesized - two separate Claude API calls where Maya creates concept cards in API Call #1 but generates different styling in API Call #2 because she lacks the complete conversation context. Added comprehensive tracking logs to monitor context preservation between calls. API Call #1 (concept creation) and API Call #2 (prompt generation) use different system prompts and conversation histories, causing Maya to treat image generation as fresh requests rather than fulfilling existing styling visions. The system preserves concept names and basic styling descriptions but loses Maya's complete reasoning chain and conversation context. This explains why users see "Black turtleneck dress, camel coat" in concepts but get "ivory silk blazer" when clicking generate.

- **Maya Frontend Template Disconnect CRITICAL FIX** (Aug 30, 2025): Discovered and resolved the critical frontend template disconnect that was preventing Maya's intelligent styling descriptions from reaching users. The core issue was in concept card description extraction logic (lines 1295 & 1379) which was truncating Maya's sophisticated styling content to 120 characters instead of extracting her intelligent fashion insights. Implemented sophisticated styling word detection that identifies and preserves Maya's professional fashion language (stunning, gorgeous, sophisticated, etc.) ensuring complete styling descriptions reach the frontend. Users now see Maya's full styling intelligence like "This stunning business ensemble features sophisticated tailoring that conveys authority while maintaining approachable elegance" instead of truncated fragments ending with "...". Combined with previous intelligence preservation fixes, Maya now delivers complete styling expertise from generation through to user interface.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **Routing**: Wouter.
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system.

- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, custom hooks for local state.
- **PWA Support**: Progressive Web App features for mobile optimization.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with agent-specific routing, unified `/api/maya/*` endpoint for consistent Maya personality via `PersonalityManager`.
- **Authentication**: Express sessions with role-based access control.
- **File Operations**: Direct tool access for admin agents.
- **Agent System**: Specialized AI agents (Elena, Zara) with autonomous capabilities and database-connected memory for context persistence.

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations.
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for training images and user uploads.
- **Session Storage**: Express session store for user authentication.

### Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
- **Session Management**: Express-session middleware.
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin vs. member agent separation with capability restrictions.
- **Agent Security**: Middleware enforcing tool access permissions.
- **API Protection**: Route-level authentication guards and admin token validation.

### System Design Choices
- Comprehensive separation between member revenue features and admin operational improvements.
- Multi-agent coordination system with task delegation, automated execution, and workflow templates.
- Local processing engine for token optimization, handling pattern extraction, session context updates, and intent classification.
- Selective Claude API bypass for token optimization on JSON tool calls while preserving full conversations.
- Project protection rules via `AdminContextManager` safeguard sensitive revenue systems and define safe development zones.
- Enhanced Path Intelligence prevents conflicts.
- An "Extraordinary Agent Handoff System" enables autonomous agent-to-agent task completion.
- A "Comprehensive Ecosystem Analysis & Protection" framework documents the multi-agent system's architecture, capabilities, and protection rules.
- The Maya system provides a 6-step discovery flow (Welcome ‚Üí Current Situation ‚Üí Future Vision ‚Üí Business Context ‚Üí Style Discovery ‚Üí Photo Goals) and seamlessly transitions to personality-driven chat and image generation. Intelligent Quick Actions generate contextual suggestions, replacing generic templated buttons. A Welcome page offers "CUSTOMIZE" (guided onboarding) or "QUICK START" (immediate photo generation) options.
- Category-aware styling system ensures Maya's AI adapts presets based on detected categories from user requests (e.g., Business, Lifestyle, Travel).
- Critical hardcoded limitations on Maya's creative output (e.g., rigid "REQUIRED STRUCTURE" templates, forceful anatomy keyword injection, portrait restrictions) have been removed or mitigated to allow for more creative freedom, diverse shot types, and natural styling descriptions.
- Conversational elements from Maya's responses are systematically removed from image generation prompts to prevent contamination and ensure clean, focused inputs for AI models.
- The system ensures consistency between Maya's original styling context and generated images, preserving creative vision.
- Improvements to gallery saving and historical concept card display ensure proper functionality and user experience.
- Editorial style audit and upgrades enhance the Maya page's UI/UX, aligning it with brand guidelines.
- Maya's styling intelligence is directly connected to image generation through a pipeline optimization, using 19 categories and 5 styling approaches each, ensuring unique and professional outputs.
- A multi-layered prompt flow cleanup eliminates formatting interruptions and ensures natural, flowing FLUX prompts.
- FLUX parameters are optimized for close-up portrait realism while maintaining quality for half-body and full scenery shots, with updated guidance scales and steps.
