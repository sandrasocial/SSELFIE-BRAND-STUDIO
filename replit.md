# SSELFIE Studio - AI Personal Branding Platform

## Overview
SSELFIE Studio is Sandra's AI personal branding platform designed to simplify personal branding by generating unlimited professional brand photos using AI, replacing traditional photoshoots. It operates with a core TRAIN → STYLE → GALLERY workflow. The platform targets women entrepreneurs with a $47/month subscription, aiming for an initial launch MRR of $2,350 by leveraging an existing large follower base. The long-term vision includes scaling this success and potentially selling the underlying admin agent ecosystem to enterprises, with strategic plans for future market expansion while maintaining the core brand identity.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Preferences: Keep technical controls hidden - users prefer Maya to handle technical details automatically rather than exposing preset/seed parameters.
PROJECT STATUS: LAUNCH READY - Simplified to core TRAIN → STYLE → GALLERY flow for immediate €47/month launch. Maya authentication cleaned for production - development access removed for professional launch experience.

## Recent Changes (August 29, 2025)
**Maya Intelligence System Optimization Complete:**
- **Phase 1**: Context preservation with originalContext field eliminates description-prompt inconsistencies
- **Phase 2**: Unified context system with AI-first categorization respects Maya's intelligent styling decisions  
- **Phase 3**: Performance optimization with lazy generation and memory caching reduces Claude API calls by ~50%
- **System Cleanup**: Legacy code removal and production optimization completed
- **Hardcode Elimination**: Complete audit identified and removed 25+ hardcoded fashion items (camel coat, blazer, silk camisole, cashmere, structured bag, etc.) that were overriding Maya's styling intelligence
- **Gallery Duplicate Fix**: Resolved critical issue where ALL generated images appeared in gallery instead of only user-hearted images. Fixed `/api/gallery-images` endpoint to filter for explicitly saved images only.
- **FLUX Prompt Quality Fix**: Fixed critical image quality issue caused by prompt contamination. Maya's conversational formatting (**, -, headers) was being sent to FLUX instead of clean technical prompts. Implemented intelligent prompt extraction that preserves Maya's complete styling expertise while ensuring FLUX receives clean descriptive text. NO hardcoding added - Maya's AI intelligence drives all styling decisions.
- **Maya Onboarding Simplification Phase 1**: Completed database schema simplification from 23+ complex fields to 7 core fields that actually matter. Safely migrated all existing data while preserving Maya's complete conversation intelligence (maya_chat_messages, maya_chats, maya_personal_memory tables remain 100% intact). Reduced user_personal_brand to essential fields: transformationStory, currentSituation, futureVision, businessGoals, businessType, stylePreferences, photoGoals.
- **Maya Onboarding Simplification Phase 2**: Removed legacy components and duplicate tables. Dropped onboarding_data and user_style_profile tables (data safely migrated in Phase 1). Deleted complex onboarding frontend components (onboarding.tsx, brand-onboarding.tsx). Cleaned up routing and server functions while preserving Maya's complete conversation intelligence. Architecture now simplified with single user_personal_brand table and direct workspace routing.
- **Maya Onboarding Simplification Phase 3**: Created beautiful profile questionnaire in Maya's voice and style. Replaced technical onboarding forms with 7 conversational questions that feel like coffee with your best friend. Interactive suggestion buttons make it easy for users to get started, with full customization options. Beautiful SSELFIE luxury aesthetic with editorial typography and responsive design. Users can now complete their profile through Maya's warm, encouraging conversation rather than intimidating forms.
- **Maya Name Field Enhancement**: Added personalization capability by including a name field as the first question in Maya's profile questionnaire. Maya can now address users personally by their preferred name throughout all conversations, making interactions feel warm, personal, and genuine. Seamlessly integrated with existing 8-question flow and Maya's conversation intelligence system.
- **Maya FLUX 1.1 Pro Optimization (August 29, 2025)**: Enhanced Maya's prompting system with research-backed improvements for optimal image generation:
  - **Phase 1**: Updated promptGuidance arrays with professional camera specifications (Canon EOS R5, Sony A7R V), enhanced quality tags including "visible skin pores", "subsurface scattering", "DSLR quality", and physical feature description templates
  - **Phase 2**: Optimized unified route with FLUX 1.1 Pro optimal prompt structure (50-150 words target), enhanced prompt cleaning to remove Maya self-references while preserving styling intelligence, and improved technical instructions with specific camera settings for different shot types  
  - **Phase 3**: Integrated comprehensive validation system with prompt length validation, trigger word consistency checks, and technical quality verification. Added generation-validator.ts with intelligent prompt cleaning and validation functions specifically tuned for Maya's conversation-to-technical conversion.
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Changed default image count from 2 to 1 per concept to eliminate "twins in one picture" issue. Maya now generates one perfect styling per concept card.
  - **RESEARCH-BASED QUALITY OPTIMIZATION (August 29, 2025)**: Implemented 2025 research findings for maximum FLUX quality:
    - **Guidance Scale**: Optimized to 3.5 (was 2.4-2.8) for superior prompt adherence and detail quality
    - **Inference Steps**: Increased to 50 steps (was 35-42) for professional-grade image refinement
    - **LoRA Weights**: Research-optimal 0.9-1.0 (was 1.4-1.6) for natural, non-overexposed results
    - **Megapixels**: Enhanced to 1.5-2.0 (was 1.0) for higher resolution without quality artifacts
  - **Result**: Significantly improved image quality with better prompt adherence, natural user likeness, and professional detail rendering.
- **Complete Hardcode Elimination (August 29, 2025)**: Removed all remaining hardcoded styling guidance that was overriding Maya's natural intelligence:
  - **Eliminated**: All hardcoded physical feature assumptions (eye color, hair color, specific facial features) that Maya doesn't know about users
  - **Eliminated**: All hardcoded outfit descriptions (blazers, specific colors, fabric types) across all 16+ concept categories
  - **Preserved**: Technical camera specifications, lighting setups, and photography quality parameters that enhance FLUX generation
  - **Result**: Maya now uses pure AI intelligence for all styling decisions while maintaining optimal technical prompting structure for FLUX 1.1 Pro
- **Result**: Perfect consistency between Maya's concept descriptions and generated prompts with blazing performance. Maya now exercises full creative authority with research-optimized FLUX prompting, and the correct user journey is restored: Maya chat stores ALL images permanently, SSELFIE gallery only shows user-hearted favorites. FLUX now receives clean technical prompts while preserving Maya's styling intelligence. Database is now simplified for clean 7-field profile questionnaire while maintaining Maya's complete conversational AI capabilities.
