## CRITICAL PLATFORM AUDIT - JULY 09, 2025

### 🚨 MAJOR CONFUSION IDENTIFIED
The platform has become overly complex with multiple pricing tiers, broken onboarding flow, and fragmented Sandra AI. User feedback confirms the need for radical simplification.

### 📋 AUDIT FINDINGS
1. **Multiple Pricing Confusion**: €47/€97/€147 options create decision paralysis

4. **Fragmented AI**: Multiple Sandra AI interfaces, no unified agent

### 🎯 SIMPLIFIED VISION (Per User Request)
- **ONE PRODUCT**: €97 SSELFIE STUDIO
- **SIMPLE FLOW**: Sign Up → Onboarding → Train AI → STUDIO (AI Photoshoot + Landing Builder)
- **UNIFIED SANDRA AI**: One agent that learns user's business, voice, mission
- **300 MONTHLY GENERATIONS**: Clear usage limit

### 🛠️ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED
1. Simplify pricing to single €97 product
2. Rebuild onboarding with proper data collection
