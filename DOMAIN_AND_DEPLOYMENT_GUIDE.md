# SSELFIE Studio Domain & Deployment Guide

## üö® DNS Fix Required (Domain Host)

Your domain `sselfie.ai` is working but `www.sselfie.ai` has no DNS record, causing browser compatibility issues.

**Login to your domain registrar (Porkbun) and add:**

### Option 1: A Record (Recommended)
- **Type**: A Record
- **Name**: `www`
- **Value**: `34.111.179.208`
- **TTL**: 600

### Option 2: CNAME Record (Alternative)
- **Type**: CNAME
- **Name**: `www`
- **Value**: `sselfie.ai`
- **TTL**: 600

## üöÄ Auth Bridge Deployment

The new branded auth bridge won't show in preview mode. It needs to be deployed to production.

**To deploy:**
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Or manually deploy to your hosting provider

## üîß Enhanced Domain Compatibility

I've added enhanced domain handling:

### Server-Side Improvements:
- Enhanced HTTPS enforcement for `sselfie.ai`
- Automatic `www` subdomain redirect
- Better cross-browser compatibility
- Domain health check endpoint: `/api/health-check`

### Client-Side Improvements:
- `DomainHelpers` utility for domain compatibility
- Automatic HTTPS enforcement
- Browser compatibility warnings
- Domain health monitoring

## üåê New Auth Bridge Features

Once deployed, users will experience:

### Instead of this confusing flow:
1. Click login ‚Üí Replit OAuth screen (confusing)
2. Generic "SSELFIE STUDIO would like to access your Replit account"
3. Technical permission list

### They'll see this smooth flow:
1. Click login ‚Üí SSELFIE branded bridge page
2. "Taking you to your AI photography studio..."
3. "Just one quick step to access your studio"
4. Then Replit OAuth (but with proper context)

## üîç Testing After Deployment

1. **Test domain access:**
   - `https://sselfie.ai` (should work)
   - `https://www.sselfie.ai` (should redirect to main domain)
   - `http://sselfie.ai` (should redirect to HTTPS)

2. **Test auth flow:**
   - Visit `https://sselfie.ai/login`
   - Should see branded loading screen
   - Then smooth OAuth flow

3. **Test cross-browser:**
   - Chrome, Safari, Firefox
   - All should work consistently

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Fix DNS**: Add `www` A record in Porkbun
2. **Deploy**: Deploy to production to see auth bridge
3. **Test**: Verify domain and auth flow work across browsers

## üîÑ Admin Access Issue

You're still logged in as test account `42585527@example.com`. To get unlimited admin access:

1. Logout from current account
2. Login with `ssa@ssasocial.com` 
3. You'll get unlimited generation privileges

This is why you see "canGenerate: false" in the logs.
