# CODEBASE CLEANUP REPORT

## Issues Identified

### 1. Agent File Modifications Gone Wrong
- Agents created corrupt CSS files in `client/src/styles/agent-generated.css`
- Test files scattered throughout the codebase
- Broken agent system files creating syntax errors

### 2. Claude API Rate Limiting
- 529 overloaded errors preventing agent responses
- Need to implement retry logic with backoff

### 3. Cleanup Actions Taken

#### Files Removed:
- All `*agent-generated*` files
- Test components created by agents
- Broken agent fix scripts

#### Next Steps:
1. Restart server to clear cached modules
2. Test Elena workflow system with clean codebase
3. Implement rate limiting safeguards
