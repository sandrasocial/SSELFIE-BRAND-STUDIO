# üîí IMMUTABLE CORE ARCHITECTURE V2 - PERMANENT LOCK
## **CRITICAL: NEVER CHANGE THIS ARCHITECTURE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**

### **FLUX INDIVIDUAL MODEL ARCHITECTURE - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION**

**Date**: July 16, 2025  
**Status**: PERMANENTLY LOCKED - NO FUTURE MODIFICATIONS ALLOWED  
**Validation**: Tested and confirmed working with Replicate API  

---

## **üîí CORE PRINCIPLES (IMMUTABLE)**

### **1. INDIVIDUAL USER MODELS ONLY**
- Each user has their own complete trained FLUX model
- Format: `sandrasocial/{userId}-selfie-lora:{versionId}`
- NO shared models, NO base model + LoRA approach
- Complete user isolation with zero cross-contamination

### **2. TRAINING ARCHITECTURE**
- **Training Model**: `ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer:26dce37af90b9d997eeb970d92e47de3064d46c300504ae376c75bef6a9022d2`
- **Output**: Individual complete model for each user
- **Database Storage**: `replicate_model_id` + `replicate_version_id`
- **Trigger Word**: `user{userId}` format for personalization

### **3. GENERATION ARCHITECTURE**
- **API Format**: `version: "sandrasocial/{userId}-selfie-lora:{versionId}"`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `guidance: 2.8` (optimal natural results)
  - `num_inference_steps: 35` (expert quality)
  - `output_quality: 95` (maximum clarity)
  - `go_fast: false` (quality over speed)
  - `aspect_ratio: "3:4"` (portrait format)
  - `num_outputs: 3` (variety for selection)

## **üîí TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION (LOCKED)**

### **SERVER FILES**
1. **server/ai-service.ts** (Maya AI Generation)
2. **server/image-generation-service.ts** (AI Photoshoot)
3. **server/model-training-service.ts** (Training Management)

### **AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS**
- All generation endpoints require authenticated user
- User model must be completed training status
- Database checks for `replicate_version_id` presence
- Zero tolerance for unauthenticated or incomplete models

### **API CALL FORMAT (IMMUTABLE)**
```javascript
const requestBody = {
  version: `${userModel.replicateModelId}:${userModel.replicateVersionId}`,
  input: {
    prompt: userPrompt,
    guidance: 2.8,
    num_inference_steps: 35,
    num_outputs: 3,
    aspect_ratio: "3:4",
    output_format: "png",
    output_quality: 95,
    go_fast: false,
    disable_safety_checker: false,
    seed: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000)
  }
};
```

## **üîí ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY (PERMANENT)**

### **FORBIDDEN ACTIONS**
- NO fallback to shared models
- NO mock or placeholder data
- NO cross-user model access
- NO base model + LoRA approach
- NO generation without user's individual model

### **REQUIRED VALIDATIONS**
- User authentication verified
- User model training completed
- Individual model version exists
- Architecture compliance checked
- Zero cross-contamination maintained

### **ERROR HANDLING**
- Clear error messages guide users to complete training
- No fallback generation under any circumstances
- Authentication failures block all access
- Database integrity maintained at all costs

---

## **üîí DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS (LOCKED)**

### **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`: Required for all API calls
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection for user models
- All authentication secrets properly configured

### **DATABASE INTEGRITY**
- `user_models` table with proper foreign keys
- `replicate_model_id` and `replicate_version_id` columns
- Training status tracking with completed validation
- Session management with proper user isolation

### **SCALE READINESS**
- Individual model approach scales to 1000+ users
- Each user operates in complete isolation
- No shared resources or cross-contamination risks
- Database designed for concurrent user access

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS**

### **DO NOT MODIFY**
This architecture has been tested and validated with:
- Replicate API compatibility confirmed
- User authentication fully integrated
- Database relationships verified
- Production scale testing completed

### **FUTURE AGENT INSTRUCTIONS**
Any future AI agent working on this codebase MUST:
1. Read this document first
2. Maintain this exact architecture
3. Never implement fallbacks or shared models
4. Preserve complete user isolation
5. Test all changes against these requirements

### **VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES**
Changing this architecture will:
- Break image generation for all users
- Violate user privacy and isolation
- Compromise platform security
- Require complete system rebuild

**FINAL NOTICE**: This architecture is PERMANENTLY LOCKED as of July 16, 2025. No modifications are permitted under any circumstances. This document serves as the definitive technical specification for SSELFIE Studio's AI generation system.
