# CACHING ISSUE FIX - July 16, 2025

## Problem Identified
- Browser heavily caching old versions of the app
- Users need to use incognito browser to see updates
- WebSocket connection errors causing development issues
- Service Worker aggressively caching static assets

## Root Causes
1. **PWA Service Worker**: Caching static assets and JS/CSS files
2. **No Cache Headers**: Missing cache-control headers on development
3. **WebSocket Config**: Invalid localhost:undefined URLs in development
4. **Build Hash Caching**: Browser caching versioned JS/CSS files

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Cache Control Headers Added to HTML
- Added no-cache meta tags to index.html
- Forces browser to always fetch fresh content
- Prevents aggressive caching of main HTML file

### 2. Service Worker Cache Version Bump
- Updated cache version to force cache invalidation
- Old cached assets will be automatically cleared
- New service worker will take control

### 3. WebSocket Configuration (To Be Fixed)
- WebSocket trying to connect to invalid URLs
- Need to configure proper development WebSocket endpoint

## User Instructions for Immediate Fix

### Clear Browser Cache Manually:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) for hard refresh
2. Or open DevTools (F12) → Application → Storage → Clear Storage
3. Or use incognito browser until cache expires

### Alternative Quick Fix:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab → Service Workers
3. Click "Unregister" next to SSELFIE Studio service worker
4. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Technical Details
- Cache-Control headers prevent browser caching
- Service worker cache version bump forces cache invalidation
- WebSocket errors don't affect main app functionality
- PWA features will re-register automatically after cache clear

## Next Steps
1. Fix WebSocket configuration for development
2. Consider disabling service worker in development mode
3. Add cache-busting query parameters to static assets
4. Monitor for similar caching issues in production
