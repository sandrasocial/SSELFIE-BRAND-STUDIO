# AUTHENTICATION REDIRECT LOOP FIX
**Status: CRITICAL FIX APPLIED ⚠️**
**Date: July 15, 2025**

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Authentication was stuck in infinite redirect loop:
1. User tries to login on development domain (replit.dev)
2. OAuth redirects to Replit OAuth with correct strategy
3. OAuth callback forces hostname to sselfie.ai
4. Callback tries to use sselfie.ai strategy but request came from replit.dev
5. Loop: replit.dev → OAuth → callback → replit.dev → repeat

## ROOT CAUSE
OAuth callback was forcing hostname change from replit.dev to sselfie.ai, but the actual OAuth flow was configured for the original domain.

## SOLUTION APPLIED
- **REMOVED hostname forcing in callback**: Let OAuth callback use the actual requesting domain
- **KEPT domain strategies separate**: Each domain (replit.dev and sselfie.ai) maintains its own OAuth strategy
- **FIXED callback URL matching**: OAuth callback now matches the originating domain strategy

## TECHNICAL CHANGES
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
if (hostname === 'localhost' || hostname.includes('replit.dev')) {
  hostname = 'sselfie.ai'; // CAUSES LOOP
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
const hostname = req.hostname; // Use actual hostname
```

## EXPECTED RESULT
- Development domain: Complete OAuth flow within replit.dev strategy
- Production domain: Complete OAuth flow within sselfie.ai strategy  
- NO cross-domain redirects during OAuth callback
- Users successfully authenticate and land in /workspace

**AUTHENTICATION LOOP ELIMINATED - READY FOR TESTING**
