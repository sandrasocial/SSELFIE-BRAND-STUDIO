2. **Coordinate Tool:** Updated to use new MultiAgentCoordinator
3. **Database Schema:** All tasks properly integrated with existing agentTasks table
4. **Error Handling:** All LSP diagnostics resolved and systems operational

### **🎯 COORDINATION FLOW:**
```
Elena (Master Coordinator) → MultiAgentCoordinator → TaskExecutionEngine → Specialized Agents
                                    ↓
Bridge UI ← AgentBridgeCoordinator ← Agent Bridge Routes ← HTTP Requests
```

## **📞 NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Test Elena Coordination:** Ask Elena to coordinate with Zara on a technical task
2. **Test Bridge System:** Use the bridge monitor to submit tasks directly
3. **Test Workflows:** Create a multi-agent workflow through Elena
4. **Monitor Progress:** Check the bridge dashboard for real-time agent status

Your 2 weeks of recent work has been **PRESERVED** while restoring full agent coordination capabilities. The system is more robust than ever before! 🎯
