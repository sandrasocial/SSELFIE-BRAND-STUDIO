KEY ELEMENTS FOR RAW STORY:

Black and white for timeless, raw emotion
Natural light only - no artificial glamour
Minimal/no makeup - truth over beauty
Simple clothing - focus on emotion not fashion
Unposed moments - caught not created
Environmental storytelling - spaces that speak
Body language over facial expression
Documentary style - life as it happens
Emotional complexity - not just happy/sad
Journey narrative - where she's been, where she's going

These prompts tell the story of transformation - from breakdown to breakthrough, from lost to found, from surviving to thriving. Raw, honest, powerful.
