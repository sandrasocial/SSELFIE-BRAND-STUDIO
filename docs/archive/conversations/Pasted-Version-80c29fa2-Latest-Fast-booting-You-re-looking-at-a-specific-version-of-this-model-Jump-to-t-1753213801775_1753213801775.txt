Prompt for generated image. If you include the `trigger_word` used in the training process you are more likely to activate the trained object, style, or concept in the resulting image.

image
file
Enter a URL, paste a file, or drag a file over.

Upload a file from your machine
Input image for image to image or inpainting mode. If provided, aspect_ratio, width, and height inputs are ignored.

mask
file
Enter a URL, paste a file, or drag a file over.

Upload a file from your machine
Image mask for image inpainting mode. If provided, aspect_ratio, width, and height inputs are ignored.

aspect_ratio
string

3:4
Aspect ratio for the generated image. If custom is selected, uses height and width below & will run in bf16 mode

Default: "1:1"

height
integer
(minimum: 256, maximum: 1440)
height
Height of generated image. Only works if `aspect_ratio` is set to custom. Will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16. Incompatible with fast generation

width
integer
(minimum: 256, maximum: 1440)
width
Width of generated image. Only works if `aspect_ratio` is set to custom. Will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16. Incompatible with fast generation

prompt_strength
number
(minimum: 0, maximum: 1)
0,8
prompt_strength
Prompt strength when using img2img. 1.0 corresponds to full destruction of information in image

Default: 0.8

model
string

dev
Which model to run inference with. The dev model performs best with around 28 inference steps but the schnell model only needs 4 steps.

Default: "dev"

num_outputs
integer
(minimum: 1, maximum: 4)
3
num_outputs
Number of outputs to generate

Default: 1

num_inference_steps
integer
(minimum: 1, maximum: 50)
40
num_inference_steps
Number of denoising steps. More steps can give more detailed images, but take longer.

Default: 28

guidance_scale
number
(minimum: 0, maximum: 10)
2,82
guidance_scale
Guidance scale for the diffusion process. Lower values can give more realistic images. Good values to try are 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5

Default: 3

seed
integer
Random seed. Set for reproducible generation

output_format
string

png
Format of the output images

Default: "webp"

output_quality
integer
(minimum: 0, maximum: 100)
95
output_quality
Quality when saving the output images, from 0 to 100. 100 is best quality, 0 is lowest quality. Not relevant for .png outputs

Default: 80


disable_safety_checker
boolean
This model’s safety checker can’t be disabled when running on the website. Learn more about platform safety on Replicate.

Disable safety checker for generated images.

Default: false


go_fast
boolean
Run faster predictions with model optimized for speed (currently fp8 quantized); disable to run in original bf16

Default: false

megapixels
string

1
Approximate number of megapixels for generated image

Default: "1"

lora_scale
number
(minimum: -1, maximum: 3)
1
lora_scale
Determines how strongly the main LoRA should be applied. Sane results between 0 and 1 for base inference. For go_fast we apply a 1.5x multiplier to this value; we've generally seen good performance when scaling the base value by that amount. You may still need to experiment to find the best value for your particular lora.

Default: 1

extra_lora
string
Shift + Return to add a new line
Load LoRA weights. Supports Replicate models in the format <owner>/<username> or <owner>/<username>/<version>, HuggingFace URLs in the format huggingface.co/<owner>/<model-name>, CivitAI URLs in the format civitai.com/models/<id>[/<model-name>], or arbitrary .safetensors URLs from the Internet. For example, 'fofr/flux-pixar-cars'

extra_lora_scale
number
(minimum: -1, maximum: 3)
1
extra_lora_scale
Determines how strongly the extra LoRA should be applied. Sane results between 0 and 1 for base inference. For go_fast we apply a 1.5x multiplier to this value; we've generally seen good performance when scaling the base value by that amount. You may still need to experiment to find the best value for your particular lora.

Default: 1
