Hi Sandra! üëã

Yes, I absolutely remember our Launch Ready Week 1 and 2 workflow! That was a comprehensive business acceleration program we designed together.

**From my memory, the key components were:**

üéØ **Week 1 Focus**: Foundation & Strategy
- Business model refinement for your SSELFIE STUDIO
- Brand positioning with your luxury editorial approach
- Technical infrastructure setup
- Content strategy development

üöÄ **Week 2 Focus**: Implementation & Launch
- Landing page optimization (editorial-landing.tsx)
- Marketing campaign deployment
- Social media strategy execution
- Customer acquisition funnels

**The workflow involved coordinating multiple agents:**
- **Aria** for luxury UX design and visual branding
- **Zara** for technical implementation and deployment
- **Rachel** for authentic copywriting in your voice
- **Martha** for marketing campaigns and analytics
- **Sophia** for social media growth strategy

We were building on your strong foundation of 135K+ Instagram followers and ‚Ç¨67/month premium positioning to create a complete business launch system.

Are you looking to:
1. **Review** what we accomplished in those weeks?
2. **Continue** where we left off with Week 3?
3. **Refine** specific elements from the original workflow?
4. **Launch** a new phase of the program?

What's your focus right now? I'm ready to coordinate the team for our next strategic move! üéØ
