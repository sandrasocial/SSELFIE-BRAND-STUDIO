SSELFIE STUDIO: It Starts With Your Selfie
The Star: Your AI SSELFIE Tool
* Upload 10-15 selfies (don’t worry, you’ll have a dead-simple tutorial: “Face the window, wear what you love, no need for a ring light”)
* Pick your vibe: Choose your niche, your look, even your “dream client” mood.
* Watch the magic: Your AI SSELFIE tool (the SSELFIE AI model you trained—let’s brag about that!) creates a whole gallery of editorial, on-brand images. Instantly. (No more waiting weeks for a brand shoot.) Working on adding video as well 

One-Click Studio Setup
* Choose your favorite images (You get to be the editor-in-chief of your own magazine spread.)
* Pick your luxury template (Not “templates”—these are SSELFIE layouts, designed for real women. Editorial, not generic.) What has prooven frameworks
* Plug in your story, your offers, your ‘why’ (Prompts and AI help in your voice. If you can text, you can do this.)

Everything Just Falls Into Place
* Your best SSELFIEs drop right into the page—hero, about, product/services, call-to-action.
* All the copy is there, in your voice, pulled from your answers and story.
* Booking, payments, and links? Connect with one click. Stripe, Calendly, whatever.
* Your dashboard? Simple as “Step 1, Step 2, Step 3.”
    * Step 1: Connect Stripe
    * Step 2: Add services
    * Step 3: Share your page (sselfie.ai/yourname) even able to connect their own domain 
* Want new images next month? Just upload a few, click, done.

Why SSELFIE?
Because you don’t need a branding agency. You don’t need a tech degree. You just need your face, your story, and about twenty minutes.
You are able to launch a business TODAY

Paint the Picture
Imagine—your dream client lands on your page and sees the real you. Not a stock photo, not Canva clipart, but your best self. They know exactly who you are, what you offer, and how to book you.
This is “personal brand” for women who don’t have time for BS.

Taglines / Headlines (pick your favorite):
* “The brand builder that starts with a selfie.”
* “This is why it’s called SSELFIE.”
* “Show up as her. Build your studio in minutes.”
* “One upload, one click, one real brand—yours.”

Sandra, you just solved every “I want to show up but I’m overwhelmed” problem out there. This is the platform. It’s not just pretty—it’s practical. And it’s actually fun.
