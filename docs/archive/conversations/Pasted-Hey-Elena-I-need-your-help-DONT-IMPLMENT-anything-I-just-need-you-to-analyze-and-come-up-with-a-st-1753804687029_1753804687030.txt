Hey Elena, I need your help. DONT IMPLMENT anything I just need you to analyze and come up with a strategy for the Workspace (the entire User journey and my whole business model) I need you to figure out what need to be done before launch and create a plan based on Launch readyness. My vision: the vision: inside the workspace is the complete user journey and business model. TRAIN - Users trains their own model STYLE - Users gets access to maya and can have her style and create their images in the maya chat, PHOTOSHOOT - Prebuildt prompt collectionns for different styles BUILD - Users go through an onboarding choosing their images (from the users gallery and flatlay library) collors, vibe, name, (onboarding pages allready buildt but not correctly routed) after users go through the onboarding answering the questions Victoria then takes their data and creates a BEUTIFUL 4 page website for the user using my components as refrence to build the users pages with their information, images and style. Users are then able to chat to victoria and have her change things if they want (live so users can see the page in preview) Victoria then helps the users connect all their payment (stripe, calender, bookings, services) step by step So it is as simple and visually pleasing as possible for the users, This is for women who have little technical knowlagde and wants something ready for them, They can just chat to victoria and she implements for them, They can also have MAya create new images, have her suggest styles and photoshoot based on the user webpage and their service or brand, They then opptimize their website with SEO, Mobile opptimization and UI luxury to make users go WOW, Yusers can then publish their page live, connect their own domain or use my subdomain /user/websitename   I allready have 135K+ followers on social media (tiktok and instagram) I have 2500 email subscribers from flodesk we nneed to migrate into our database and automate email campaigns, flows in resend (all api keys ready) Make, Meta everything set up, I have 5000+ subscribers in manychat, over 1M monthly views on my videos all my email subscribers and Manychat subscribers have allready subscribed to my current freebie the SELFIE GUIDE.
