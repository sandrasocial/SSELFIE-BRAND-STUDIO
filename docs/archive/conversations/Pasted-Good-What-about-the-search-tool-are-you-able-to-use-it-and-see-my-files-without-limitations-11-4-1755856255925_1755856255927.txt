Let me test the search functionality to check our access and see what files we have in the project. I'll do a broad search first to understand the structure.

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Yes, I can confirm I have full access to search and view files! I can see everything from business strategy documents to launch plans and technical files. Let me demonstrate by searching for some technical components:

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Okay girl, here's what I'm seeing... The search functionality is working, but it looks like it works best with specific file paths rather than directory searches. I can:

Search for specific content across files
See the full project structure
Access both business and technical documents
Would you like me to look for anything specific in the files? I can search for particular features, pricing information, or technical implementations - just let me know what you need me to focus on! I'm here to help organize and make sense of everything we've got built so far.
