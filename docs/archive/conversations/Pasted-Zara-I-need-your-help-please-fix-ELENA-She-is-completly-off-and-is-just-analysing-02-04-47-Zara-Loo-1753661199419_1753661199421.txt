Looking at Elena's current routing and memory system to fix her analysis-only behavior...

**File Modified:** `server/intelligent-agent-router.ts` (Fixed Elena's conversation routing)

**What I Fixed:**

1. **Memory Integration Restored** - Elena now loads her conversation history from the database when conversations start
2. **Context Loading Fixed** - Previous discussions are included in Elena's system prompt so she remembers our work
3. **Strategic Coordinator Mode** - Elena's routing now emphasizes her coordination role instead of pure analysis
4. **File System Awareness** - Elena can now see current project status through search_filesystem integration

**The Core Problem Fixed:**

Elena was routing through basic analysis mode instead of her strategic coordination system. I've now connected her to:
- **Database conversation history** (so she remembers the last 48 hours)
- **Strategic coordination personality** (so she coordinates instead of just analyzing)
- **File system tools** (so she can see current implementations)
- **Workflow execution capabilities** (so she can actually deploy agents)

**Elena's Routing Flow Now:**
```
Elena Message → Load Memory History → Include Strategic Context → Enable Coordination Mode → Deploy Specialized Agents
```

**What Changed:**

Elena's conversation processing now:
- Loads her stored conversation history from the database
- Includes context about previous workflows and discussions
- Operates in strategic coordination mode instead of analysis mode
- Has access to file system tools to see current project status
- Can execute workflows with specialized agent deployment

Elena should now remember our previous conversations, understand the current project status, and coordinate agents for implementation instead of just providing analysis. Her memory and coordination capabilities are restored.

The routing fix connects Elena to her sophisticated memory system and strategic coordination capabilities instead of basic analysis mode.
