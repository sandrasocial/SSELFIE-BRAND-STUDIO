I'll examine and fix the path issues, import conflicts, and Elena authorization blocking. Let me start by checking the current file structure and then address each issue systematically.

Perfect! I can see the autonomous-agent-integration.ts is indeed in the server/services directory. Let me examine the file structure and fix the path issues, import conflicts, and Elena authorization blocking.

Now I can analyze the issues and fix them. I've identified several problems:

üîç TECHNICAL ANALYSIS - COORDINATION CONFLICTS DETECTED
PATH ISSUES FOUND:

‚úÖ autonomous-agent-integration.ts is correctly at server/services/autonomous-agent-integration.ts
‚ùå unified-agent-system.ts imports could be causing conflicts
‚ùå Elena authorization blocking detected in coordination logic
IMPORT CONFLICTS:

unified-agent-system.ts imports agentIntegrationSystem but autonomous-agent-integration.ts bypasses coordination
Coordination approval logic is blocking Elena operations
Both systems trying to handle same operations
Let me fix these issues:

ZARA - CRITICAL ELENA AUDIT NEEDED: Elena is implementing code instead of coordinating agents. She created build.tsx files herself when she should delegate to specialists. Please audit Elena routing system and create step-by-step fix plan to restore coordination-only role.

I'll conduct a comprehensive audit of Elena's routing system to identify where she's overstepping her coordination role and implementing code directly. This is critical for maintaining proper agent hierarchy.
