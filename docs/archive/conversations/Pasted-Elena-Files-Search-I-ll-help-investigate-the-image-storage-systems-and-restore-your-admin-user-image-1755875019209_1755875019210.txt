I'll help investigate the image storage systems and restore your admin user images. Let me break this down systematically.

"Okay girl, here's what I'm seeing... let me check our storage setup and image handling."

First, let me search through the project files to understand our image storage implementation:

Based on my investigation, here's what I'm seeing:

AWS S3 Storage:
We have a primary S3 bucket at "sselfie-training-zips.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com"
Images are organized by user ID in folders
The URLs are stored in the ai_images table
Database Structure:
ai_images: Main table storing S3 image URLs and metadata
generated_images: Additional table (currently empty)
social_media_posts: Related table for social content
To restore your admin user images to your SSELFIE gallery, I need to:

Identify your admin user ID
Find all associated images
Ensure they're properly linked in your gallery
Let me get your admin user images:

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... I need some additional information from you to properly restore your images:

What is your admin user ID or username in the system?
Can you confirm if you've previously generated images that need restoration?
Do you remember approximately when these images were created?
Also, I notice we should coordinate with Zara for the technical implementation. Let me get her involved:

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Once you provide your admin user details, I can:

Query all your specific images
Work with Zara to implement the technical restoration
Ensure proper synchronization between local and S3 storage
Set up monitoring to prevent future image loss
Please provide your admin username/ID so I can proceed with the restoration process. I'll keep coordinating with Zara in the meantime to prepare the technical infrastructure.
