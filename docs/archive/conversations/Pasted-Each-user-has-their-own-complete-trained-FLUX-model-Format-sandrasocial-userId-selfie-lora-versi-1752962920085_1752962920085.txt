Each user has their own complete trained FLUX model
Format: sandrasocial/{userId}-selfie-lora:{versionId}
NO shared models, NO base model + LoRA approach
Complete user isolation with zero cross-contamination
2. TRAINING ARCHITECTURE
Training Model: ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer:26dce37af90b9d997eeb970d92e47de3064d46c300504ae376c75bef6a9022d2
Output: Individual complete model for each user
Database Storage: replicate_model_id + replicate_version_id
Trigger Word: user{userId} format for personalization
3. GENERATION ARCHITECTURE
API Format: version: "sandrasocial/{userId}-selfie-lora:{versionId}"
Parameters:
guidance: 2.8 (optimal natural results)
num_inference_steps: 35 (expert quality)
output_quality: 95 (maximum clarity)
go_fast: false (quality over speed)
aspect_ratio: "3:4" (portrait format)
num_outputs: 3 (variety for selection)
🔒 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION (LOCKED)
SERVER FILES
server/ai-service.ts (Maya AI Generation)
server/image-generation-service.ts (AI Photoshoot)
server/model-training-service.ts (Training Management)
AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS
All generation endpoints require authenticated user
User model must be completed training status
Database checks for replicate_version_id presence
Zero tolerance for unauthenticated or incomplete models
API CALL FORMAT (IMMUTABLE)
const requestBody = {
  version: `${userModel.replicateModelId}:${userModel.replicateVersionId}`,
  input: {
    prompt: userPrompt,
    guidance: 2.8,
    num_inference_steps: 35,
    num_outputs: 3,
    aspect_ratio: "3:4",
    output_format: "png",
    output_quality: 95,

  }
};
🔒 ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY (PERMANENT)
FORBIDDEN ACTIONS
NO fallback to shared models
NO mock or placeholder data
NO cross-user model access
NO base model + LoRA approach
NO generation without user's individual model
REQUIRED VALIDATIONS
User authentication verified
User model training completed
Individual model version exists
Architecture compliance checked
Zero cross-contamination maintained
ERROR HANDLING
Clear error messages guide users to complete training
No fallback generation under any circumstances
Authentication failures block all access
Database integrity maintained at all costs
🔒 DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS (LOCKED)
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN: Required for all API calls
DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection for user models
All authentication secrets properly configured
DATABASE INTEGRITY
user_models table with proper foreign keys
replicate_model_id and replicate_version_id columns
Training status tracking with completed validation
Session management with proper user isolation
SCALE READINESS
Individual model approach scales to 1000+ users
Each user operates in complete isolation
No shared resources or cross-contamination risks
Database designed for concurrent user access
⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS
DO NOT MODIFY
This architecture has been tested and validated with:

Replicate API compatibility confirmed
User authentication fully integrated
Database relationships verified
Production scale testing completed
FUTURE AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
Any future AI agent working on this codebase MUST:

Read this document first
Maintain this exact architecture
Never implement fallbacks or shared models
Preserve complete user isolation
Test all changes against these requirements
VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES
Changing this architecture will:

Break image generation for all users
Violate user privacy and isolation
Compromise platform security
Require complete system rebuild
FINAL NOTICE: This architecture is PERMANENTLY LOCKED as of July 16, 2025. No modifications are permitted under any circumstances. This document serves as the definitive technical specification for SSELFIE Studio's AI generation system.
