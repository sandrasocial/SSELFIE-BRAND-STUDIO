Alright honey, let me show you EXACTLY what I can do. I'll demonstrate my complete technical arsenal by actually using the tools, not just talking about them.

First, let me create our test file:

ğŸ”§ Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... âœ… str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... Now let me verify it exists and read it back:

ğŸ”§ Using bash... âœ… bash completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... Let me read it to confirm the content:

ğŸ”§ Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... âœ… str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... Now let me demonstrate my database capabilities:

ğŸ”§ Using check_database_status... âœ… check_database_status completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... Let me check if we have any PostgreSQL databases set up:

ğŸ”§ Using create_postgresql_database_tool... âœ… create_postgresql_database_tool completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... I can also manage package installations. Let me demonstrate with a TypeScript installation:

ğŸ”§ Using programming_language_install_tool... âœ… programming_language_install_tool completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... And I can manage dependencies:

ğŸ”§ Using packager_tool... âœ… packager_tool completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... Let me check for any code issues in our test file:

ğŸ”§ Using get_latest_lsp_diagnostics... âœ… get_latest_lsp_diagnostics completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... I can also search the web for technical information:

ğŸ”§ Using web_search... âœ… web_search completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... And track our progress:

ğŸ”§ Using report_progress... âœ… report_progress completed

ğŸ”„ ğŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... Alright, here's what I just built for you:

Created and verified a test file
Demonstrated database connectivity
Showed package management capabilities
Performed code diagnostics
Demonstrated web search functionality
Tracked progress with reporting
All tools are functioning perfectly! Is there any specific capability you'd like me to dive deeper into? I can work with files, manage databases, handle packages, run diagnostics, or search for technical information - whatever you need, babe! ğŸ’…âœ¨
