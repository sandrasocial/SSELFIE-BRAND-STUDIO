SSELFIE AI™ DYNAMIC TRAINING GUIDE
For Lifestyle & Editorial Results (Not Basic Portraits)
THE PROBLEM WITH CURRENT TRAINING
Most LoRA models default to portrait-style outputs because:

Training images are too similar (all headshots)
AI learns "face = portrait photo"
Lacks environmental and movement context

GENERATION SETTINGS FOR DYNAMIC OUTPUTS
javascript// Optimal for lifestyle/editorial results
const dynamicSettings = {
    prompt: "[full scene description] + raw photo, not portrait, environmental context, lifestyle photography",
    negative_prompt: "portrait, headshot, passport photo, studio shot, centered face, isolated subject",
    num_inference_steps: 32,
    guidance_scale: 2.5,  // CRITICAL - keep low
    sampler: "DPM++ 2M Karras",
    clip_skip: 1,
    width: 1024,
    height: 768,  // Wider aspect for scenes
    lora_strength: 0.85
}
PROMPT FORMULA FOR DYNAMIC RESULTS
[triggerword] woman + [ACTION VERB] + [LOCATION/CONTEXT] + [STYLE DESCRIPTORS]

Examples:
- "walking through" + "luxury hotel lobby" + "full body in motion, architectural photography"
- "working at" + "beachfront cafe" + "lifestyle scene with environment, not portrait"
- "celebrating at" + "rooftop party" + "candid social moment, event photography"
COMMON FIXES FOR BASIC OUTPUTS
If still getting portraits:

Add "full scene visible, environmental context" to every prompt
Use negative prompts aggressively
Lower guidance scale to 2.0-2.5
Generate in landscape format (1024x768)
Add movement descriptors: "in motion", "mid-gesture", "transitional moment"

Advanced technique:
javascript// Use img2img with composition reference
{
    init_image: "reference_lifestyle_photo.jpg",
    strength: 0.6,  // Keeps composition, changes face
    prompt: "[triggerword] woman in same pose and setting..."
}
TRAINING CHECKLIST
✓ 15 photos minimum (not 10)
✓ Only 3-4 close face shots (not all portraits)
✓ Mostly full/3/4 body with context
✓ Variety of activities not just standing
✓ Different locations visible in frame
✓ Natural expressions during activities
✓ Some motion blur is actually good
✓ Include hands/gestures in most shots
CAPTIONS THAT CREATE DYNAMIC RESULTS
❌ Bad: "photo of [triggerword] woman"
✅ Good: "photo of [triggerword] woman walking in city, full body street photography"
❌ Bad: "portrait of [triggerword] woman smiling"
✅ Good: "photo of [triggerword] woman laughing at cafe, lifestyle scene with environment"
❌ Bad: "[triggerword] woman headshot"
✅ Good: "photo of [triggerword] woman working at desk, overhead angle workspace visible"
FINAL TIPS

Think "movie still" not "photo shoot" - capture moments, not poses
You should be 30-50% of frame - not 90% like portraits
Include props and environment - they give context
Movement is key - even subtle motion prevents static outputs
Test prompt: If it could be a LinkedIn photo, it's too basic

This approach will give you dynamic, editorial, lifestyle results instead of basic headshots!
