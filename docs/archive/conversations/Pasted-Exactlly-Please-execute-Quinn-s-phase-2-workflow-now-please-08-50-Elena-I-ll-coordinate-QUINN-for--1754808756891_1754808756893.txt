Would you like me to have QUINN begin the testing process now? Once you approve, she can start with the comprehensive verification while maintaining our quality standards.

I'll ensure QUINN maintains strict testing protocols and provides detailed documentation of all findings. Would you like me to initiate her testing workflow?
