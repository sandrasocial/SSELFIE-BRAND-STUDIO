Elena's Strategic Analysis
📋 Current Status: After a thorough analysis, I notice we need more information about the member workspace implementation. Let me break down what I've found and what needs to be completed:

🔍 Critical Pre-Launch Requirements:

Member Workspace Implementation

Need to verify Step 4 implementation in member workspace
Ensure all member workspace steps are properly connected
Validate workspace navigation flow
Database Setup

Database connection is available
Need to verify schema implementation for member workspace data
Admin Dashboard

Admin functionality files exist but need detailed content review
Need to verify admin routes and authentication
🎯 Recommended Next Steps:

Can you please help me by showing me the exact location of:
The member workspace Step 4 component
The current member workspace implementation
This will help me provide a more accurate analysis of what specifically needs to be completed before launch.

⏱️ Timeline Estimate: Once I can verify the exact implementation status of Step 4 and the member workspace, I can provide a detailed timeline for remaining work.

Would you like me to:

Check specific member workspace files you can point me to?
Review any particular admin dashboard components?
Analyze other pre-launch requirements?
Please let me know which area you'd like me to focus on first, and I'll help coordinate getting everything ready for launch!
