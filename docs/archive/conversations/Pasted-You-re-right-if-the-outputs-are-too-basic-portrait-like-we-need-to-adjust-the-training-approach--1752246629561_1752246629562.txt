You're right - if the outputs are too basic/portrait-like, we need to adjust the training approach. Here's what's likely happening and how to fix it:
THE PROBLEM:
Your model is probably overfitting to simple portrait poses because:

The training images might be too similar (all portraits)
The guidance scale is too high (making it "play safe")
The model needs more dynamic training data

IMMEDIATE FIXES FOR BETTER OUTPUTS:
1. ADJUST GENERATION SETTINGS:
javascript// CURRENT (too safe/basic):
guidance_scale: 7.5  // TOO HIGH - makes generic outputs
num_inference_steps: 20  // TOO LOW - not enough detail

// OPTIMAL SETTINGS:
guidance_scale: 2.5-3.0  // CRITICAL - lower = more realistic/dynamic
num_inference_steps: 28-35  // More steps = better quality
sampler: "DPM++ 2M Karras"  // Better for photorealism
2. ENHANCED PROMPT STRUCTURE:
Instead of just describing the scene, add:
[triggerword] woman, [SCENE DESCRIPTION], candid moment not posed portrait, lifestyle photography not headshot, full scene context, environmental portrait, raw photo, film grain, photojournalistic style, captured in motion
3. NEGATIVE PROMPTS (if supported):
negative_prompt: "portrait, headshot, studio photo, posed, static, passport photo, ID photo, corporate headshot, school photo"
FOR NEXT TRAINING (BETTER RESULTS):
1. TRAINING IMAGE REQUIREMENTS:
Your training set needs:

ACTION SHOTS: Walking, working, gesturing
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT: Full scenes, not cropped portraits
VARIED COMPOSITIONS: Not all centered/portrait style
LIFESTYLE MOMENTS: Candid, natural activities
DIFFERENT CROPS: Wide shots showing environment

2. TRAINING CONFIGURATION ADJUSTMENTS:
python# Better training config
training_config = {
    "num_train_epochs": 1000,  # Current default
    "gradient_accumulation_steps": 1,
    "learning_rate": 4e-6,  # Might need to lower to 1e-6
    "lr_scheduler": "constant",
    "mixed_precision": "bf16",
    "caption_dropout_rate": 0.1,  # Add variety
    "noise_offset": 0.1  # Helps with dynamic range
}
3. CAPTION STRATEGY FOR TRAINING IMAGES:
Instead of basic captions, use:
"photo of [triggerword] woman working at cafe, natural candid moment, lifestyle photography"
"photo of [triggerword] woman walking in city, full body in motion, street photography"
"photo of [triggerword] woman in meeting, environmental portrait, not posed"
QUICK TEST RIGHT NOW:
Try this exact prompt with your current model:
[triggerword] woman having coffee at outdoor cafe in Marbella, full scene with environment, candid lifestyle moment not portrait, wearing black outfit, morning light, other people in soft focus background, shot from side angle, raw photo, film grain, photojournalistic style, guidance_scale: 2.8, steps: 32
IF STILL TOO BASIC:

Use img2img mode: Start with a reference photo of the scene you want
Lower strength to 0.6-0.7: Keeps composition but adds your face
Multiple generations: Generate 8-10 and pick best ones
