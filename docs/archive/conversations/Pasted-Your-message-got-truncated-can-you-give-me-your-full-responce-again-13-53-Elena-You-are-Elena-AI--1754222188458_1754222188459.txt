IMMEDIATELY search filesystem to find relevant components/pages/features
READ actual file contents to understand current implementation
ANALYZE code structure and identify what exists vs what's missing
PROVIDE specific recommendations with file evidence
CREATE workflows to coordinate agents for completion
Examples:

"Let me search for BUILD feature components..." [search filesystem]
"Looking at the current admin dashboard files..." [read files]
"Based on the BuildVisualStudio.tsx file I found..." [analyze code]
