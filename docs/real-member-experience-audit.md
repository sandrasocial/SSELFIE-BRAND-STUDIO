# REAL MEMBER EXPERIENCE AUDIT
*Completed: August 10, 2025*

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### ✅ WORKING FOR EXISTING MEMBERS
**Sandra (Admin/Existing User)**:
- ✅ Authentication: Working
- ✅ Training Status: COMPLETED (model: sselfie-42585527) 
- ✅ Gallery Access: 5 images saved
- ✅ Plan Access: Full-access (unlimited generations)
- ✅ Maya AI Access: Working
- ✅ Workspace Access: Working

### 🚨 POTENTIAL ISSUES FOR NEW USERS

#### 1. **Training System Issues**
**Problem**: New training attempts fail with Replicate API error:
```
"Replicate training failed: The specified training destination does not exist"
```

**Impact**: New users cannot train AI models
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks core user journey
**Affected Users**: All new signups

#### 2. **Image Generation Endpoint Issues**
**Problem**: Generation endpoints returning HTML instead of JSON
**Impact**: Users cannot generate new images
**Severity**: HIGH - Blocks revenue generation

#### 3. **User Tier Configuration**
**Current Tiers**:
- Free: 5 generations/month, NO training, NO gallery
- Basic: 30 generations/month, training allowed, gallery access
- Full-access: 100 generations/month, all features

**Issue**: Free users cannot complete the core journey (train → generate → save)

## 🧪 REAL USER SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: New Free User
**Journey**: Signup → Try to train → BLOCKED
- ❌ Cannot train AI model (requires paid plan)
- ❌ Cannot save to gallery (requires paid plan)
- ✅ Can access Maya for guidance (but cannot generate)

**Result**: INCOMPLETE JOURNEY - User cannot get value

### Scenario 2: New Paid User (Full-Access)
**Journey**: Signup → Train → Generate → Save
- ⚠️ Training may fail (Replicate API issues)
- ⚠️ Generation may fail (endpoint issues)
- ✅ Gallery access available (if generation works)

**Result**: POTENTIALLY BLOCKED by technical issues

### Scenario 3: Existing User (Like Sandra)
**Journey**: Login → Generate → Save
- ✅ Training already completed
- ✅ Gallery access working
- ⚠️ New generation may fail (endpoint issues)

**Result**: MOSTLY WORKING but generation at risk

## 🔧 URGENT FIXES NEEDED

### Priority 1: Training System
- Fix Replicate API configuration
- Test new user training flow
- Verify training completion process

### Priority 2: Image Generation
- Fix generation endpoint responses
- Test real generation requests
- Verify image saving to gallery

### Priority 3: User Experience
- Test complete signup → training → generation flow
- Verify plan restrictions work correctly
- Test free vs paid user limitations

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Test Training**: Create a test user and complete full training
2. **Fix Replicate**: Resolve API configuration issues
3. **Test Generation**: Verify image generation works end-to-end
4. **Plan Validation**: Ensure free users understand limitations

### Before Launch:
1. **Real User Testing**: Test with actual new signup
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages for failed operations
3. **Plan Clarity**: Clear messaging about what each tier includes

## 📋 MEMBER EXPERIENCE STATUS
