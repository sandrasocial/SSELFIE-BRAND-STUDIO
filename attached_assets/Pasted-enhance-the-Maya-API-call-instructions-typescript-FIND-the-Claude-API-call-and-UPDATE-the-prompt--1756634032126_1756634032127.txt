enhance the Maya API call instructions:
typescript// FIND the Claude API call and UPDATE the prompt instruction:

const claudeRequest = {
  model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  max_tokens: 2000,
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `GENERATE OPTIMIZED FLUX PROMPT: Transform this styling concept into a natural, flowing FLUX image generation prompt.

CONCEPT: "${conceptName}"
STYLING CONTEXT: "${cleanOriginalContext}"
${categorySpecificGuidance}

ðŸŽ¯ FLUX OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Write in NATURAL SENTENCES, not tag lists
- Use Subject â†’ Action â†’ Style â†’ Context structure  
- Front-load most important details first
- 30-80 words for optimal FLUX results
- Include specific camera/lens details for realism
- Use positive phrasing only (describe what you want)
- Natural skin texture and realistic lighting phrases

ðŸ“¸ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Start with technical prefix (DO NOT MODIFY): "${triggerWord}, raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, unretouched natural skin texture, subsurface scattering, photographed on film, professional photography, beautiful hands, detailed fingers, anatomically correct"
- Follow with natural sentence describing the styled scene
- Include camera specifications (85mm f/2.0 for portraits, 50mm f/2.8 for half-body, 24-35mm f/5.6 for scenes)
- End with natural lighting and mood description

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
"[TECHNICAL PREFIX], [Subject] [action] in [setting], [styling details described naturally], shot with [camera specs], [natural lighting], [mood/atmosphere]."

GENERATE: Complete FLUX prompt with natural flow and optimal structure.`
    }
  ]
});
Step 2.2: Add Shot Type Intelligence to Category Detection
Enhance category detection to include shot type guidance:
typescript// FIND category detection logic and ADD shot type hints:

if (contextLower.includes('business') || contextLower.includes('corporate')) {
  detectedCategory = 'Business';
  categorySpecificGuidance += '\nðŸŽ¯ SHOT TYPE HINT: Business styling typically works best with half-body or close-up shots to show professional attire and confident expression.';
} else if (contextLower.includes('lifestyle') || contextLower.includes('elevated everyday')) {
  detectedCategory = 'Lifestyle';
  categorySpecificGuidance += '\nðŸŽ¯ SHOT TYPE HINT: Lifestyle concepts work beautifully as full scene environmental shots or relaxed half-body poses.';
}
// ... continue for other categories
