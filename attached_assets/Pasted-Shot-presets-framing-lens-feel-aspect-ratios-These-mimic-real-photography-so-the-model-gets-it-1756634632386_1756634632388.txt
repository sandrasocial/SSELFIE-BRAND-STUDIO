Shot presets (framing, lens feel, aspect ratios)

These mimic real photography so the model “gets it.”

1) Close-up portrait / beauty headshot

Aspect ratio: 4:5 (IG-friendly) or 1:1. 
replicate.com

Lens feel: 85mm, f/1.8–f/2.8 for shallow background blur. 
Adobe
Digital Camera World

Guidance: 3.0–3.5 (clean fidelity). 
replicate.com

Prompt skeleton (30–60 words):
Professional beauty headshot of [subject], [expression + eye contact], editorial lifestyle photography, soft window light, clean background, subtle film grain, 85mm lens, f/2.0, shallow depth of field, natural skin texture, minimal retouch, [style reference like “magazine cover”], [location hint if needed].
(Why this works: structure + front-loaded subject/action; explicit lighting/lens/aperture adds realism.)

2) Half-body / three-quarter lifestyle

Aspect ratio: 3:4 or 4:5 for verticals that still show outfit/pose.

3) Full scene / environmental lifestyle

Aspect ratio: 3:2 or 16:9 to breathe and show place.
