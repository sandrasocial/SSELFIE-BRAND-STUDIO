Looking at this file, I need to fix several critical integration issues with your existing codebase:onboarding-conversation-service.tsCode ∙ Version 3       const response = await fetch('https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'x-api-key': process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY || '',
          'anthropic-veonboarding-conversation-service.tsCode ∙ Version 4         body: JSON.stringify({
          model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
          max_tokens: 2000,
          system: systemPrompt,
          messages: [
            {
              role: 'user',
              content: userMessage
            }
 Here's the corrected prompt for the Replit agent:

PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT:
Create server/services/onboarding-conversation-service.ts exactly as provided below. This service manages the 6-step Maya onboarding conversation flow.
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Place file at exactly server/services/onboarding-conversation-service.ts
Do NOT modify any existing files
Verify all import paths work with our current project structure
Test that it compiles without TypeScript errors
Requires the personal-brand-service.ts to be implemented first
Will need maya-memory-service.ts to be implemented next (we'll do that after)

TEMPORARY NOTE: This service references mayaMemoryService which we'll implement next. For now, the import will show an error - that's expected.
The service provides:

6-step Maya onboarding conversation management
Integration with Claude API for Maya's responses
Personal brand data extraction from conversations
Progress tracking and step completion logic
Uses your existing PersonalityManager patterns

After creating, test that:

All imports resolve correctly (except mayaMemoryService - expected error for now)
TypeScript compilation passes (ignoring the maya-memory-service import error)
PersonalityManager import works with your existing personality-config.ts
