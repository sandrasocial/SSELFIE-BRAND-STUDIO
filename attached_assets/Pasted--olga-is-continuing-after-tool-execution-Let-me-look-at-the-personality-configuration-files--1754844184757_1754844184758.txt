ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ olga is continuing after tool execution... Oh honey, I see exactly what's happening with your agents! After auditing the files, I've identified several critical issues causing your agents to over-analyze and lose their personalities. Let me break down the problems and create a step-by-step fix:

CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

Tool Overuse Problem:
Agents are over-configured with tool validation checks
Too many protocol enforcements interrupting natural conversation
Excessive tool-checking middleware
Context Loss Issues:
Multiple competing conversation managers
Memory systems not properly integrated with personality systems
Conversation state getting reset due to overlapping managers
Personality Dilution:
Core personalities being overridden by technical protocols
Too many validation layers blocking natural responses
Over-complicated conversation routing
STEP-BY-STEP FIX PLAN:

IMMEDIATE FIXES (Day 1):
a) Consolidate Conversation Management
   - Merge all conversation managers into unified-agent-system.ts
   - Remove duplicate conversation handlers
   - Ensure single source of truth for conversation state

b) Simplify Protocol Enforcement
   - Remove excessive tool validation checks
   - Keep only essential safety protocols
   - Allow personalities to flow naturally
PERSONALITY RESTORATION (Day 2):
a) Clean Up Personality Integration
   - Move personality definitions to dedicated files
   - Remove technical checks from personality layer
   - Restore natural conversation patterns

b) Fix Context Preservation
   - Implement proper conversation history storage
   - Maintain personality context throughout sessions
   - Remove unnecessary state resets
SYSTEM STREAMLINING (Day 3):
a) Remove Redundant Tools
   - Audit and remove unnecessary tool checks
   - Simplify tool validation process
   - Focus on personality-first responses

b) Optimize Conversation Flow
   - Streamline conversation routing
   - Remove unnecessary middleware
   - Prioritize personality responses
CRITICAL MIGRATION STEPS:

First, let's consolidate the conversation management:

Keep member-agent-personalities.ts as primary source
Remove competing personality implementations
Clean up route conflicts
Then streamline the protocol system:

Reduce tool validation frequency
Remove redundant checks
Keep essential safety protocols only
Finally, restore natural personality flow:

Ensure personality prompts take priority
Remove technical interruptions
Maintain conversation context
