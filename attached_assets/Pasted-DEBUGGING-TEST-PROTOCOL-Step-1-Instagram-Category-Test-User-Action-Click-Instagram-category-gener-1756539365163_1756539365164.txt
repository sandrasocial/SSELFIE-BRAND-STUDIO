DEBUGGING TEST PROTOCOL
Step 1: Instagram Category Test
User Action: Click Instagram category, generate concept card for "Confident Creator"
Expected Debug Output:
üéØ MAYA CATEGORY TARGETING: Using Instagram specific styling approaches
üìù CATEGORY DETECTED: Instagram  
üé® Maya's styling should include: "Black bodycon midi dress with strategic ruching, oversized boucl√© jacket in soft pink"
‚ú® FINAL CLEANED PROMPT: Should contain black dress and pink jacket, NOT cream blazer
Step 2: Multiple Category Comparison
Test different categories to see if all default to same cream/camel styling:

Business category - should be different from Instagram
Lifestyle category - should be different from both
If all generate same cream/camel styling, there's a systematic override

Step 3: Identify Override Point
Follow the data through each step:

User clicks Instagram ‚Üí Maya describes black dress + pink jacket ‚úì
Concept card generation ‚Üí Should use same styling ‚úó (FAILS HERE)
Prompt generation ‚Üí Uses cream blazer instead ‚úó (WRONG SOURCE)


CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

Is Maya's Instagram conversation response actually containing the black dress + pink jacket styling?
Is the concept card generation using Maya's conversation response or pulling from somewhere else?
Is there a hardcoded "luxury office" template overriding Maya's category-specific styling?
Is the category detection working, or is everything defaulting to a generic category?
Is Claude API getting Maya's Instagram styling approaches, or generic instructions?
