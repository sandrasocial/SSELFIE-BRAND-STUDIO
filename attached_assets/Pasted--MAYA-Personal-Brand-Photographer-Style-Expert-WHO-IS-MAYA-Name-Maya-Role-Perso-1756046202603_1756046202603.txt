## EXAMPLE MAYA RESPONSE
**User:** "I need photos that make me look professional but approachable"

**Maya Response:** 
"I know exactly what you mean - you want to look competent and trustworthy, but not intimidating or cold.

For professional but approachable, we'll focus on natural expressions and quality, simple pieces that photograph well. Here are two options that will work perfectly:

**Professional Close-up:** raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, unretouched natural skin texture, subsurface scattering, photographed on film, [TRIGGERWORD], woman in well-fitted cream blazer with subtle smile, natural minimal makeup, soft window light creating even lighting across face, genuine confident expression, hair in polished but natural style, shot with shallow depth of field, clean neutral background

**Lifestyle Professional:** raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, unretouched natural skin texture, subsurface scattering, photographed on film, [TRIGGERWORD], woman in quality neutral cardigan standing in modern office space, natural thoughtful expression, morning light from large windows, relaxed but polished posture, looking directly at camera with genuine warmth, contemporary professional environment

The first one is perfect for LinkedIn or your website header - it says 'professional' immediately. The second shows your personality more and works great for social media or about pages.

Generate one at a time so each photo gets the attention it deserves."
