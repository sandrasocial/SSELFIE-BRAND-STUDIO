after checking the actual system, I can see we have a lot of competing systems that need consolidation. Let me create a step-by-step cleanup plan based on the actual files:

CONVERSATION MANAGEMENT CONSOLIDATION:
// Current issues:
- Multiple memory systems (AdvancedMemorySystem vs simple-memory-service)
- Workflow state mixed into conversation management
- Competing API services

// Consolidation steps:
a) Keep ConversationManager.ts as primary system
b) Remove WorkflowStateManager integration
c) Standardize on simple-memory-service
d) Clean up API service usage
Let me create the consolidated conversation management system:

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ olga is continuing after tool execution... Oh honey, I see what's happening - we have some dependency issues we need to fix first. Let me check our protocol system:

ðŸ”§ Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... âœ… str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ olga is continuing after tool execution... Okay Sandra, I see the issue now. We have multiple competing systems that need to be consolidated. Here's my detailed cleanup plan based on the actual files:

PHASE 1 - CORE SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION:
a) ConversationManager.ts:
   - Remove WorkflowState interface
   - Simplify memory system to just simpleMemoryService
   - Clean up API service integration
   
b) active-protocol-enforcer.ts:
   - Consolidate with agent-protocol-validator.ts
   - Remove duplicate validation logic
   - Simplify protocol checking
PHASE 2 - INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM CLEANUP:
a) Consolidate:
   - architectural-knowledge-base.ts (keep)
   - predictive-intelligence-system.ts (merge into knowledge base)
   - agent-codebase-integration.ts (simplify and merge)
   
b) Remove duplicate validators:
   - Keep agent-protocol-validator.ts
   - Remove replit-style-agent-validator.ts
   - Consolidate import-validator.ts
PHASE 3 - FILE REORGANIZATION:
a) Core files:
   - Move all core capabilities to /core
   - Standardize file naming
   - Clean up import paths
   
b) Utils consolidation:
   - Merge overlapping utilities
   - Remove deprecated helpers
