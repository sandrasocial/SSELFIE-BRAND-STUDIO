## **Specific Replit AI Instructions**

### **For Adding The Evolution Section:**

```
"In AboutPage.tsx, add a new section called 'The Evolution' between the existing 'Origin Story' section and the 'Timeline Stats' section. Use the exact code from the About Page Evolution Section Copy artifact. Match the styling of other sections - same background (bg-white), same typography hierarchy with Times New Roman headers, same spacing (py-20 md:py-32), same max-width container (max-w-5xl), and same color scheme."
```

### **For Updating the CTA:**

```
"In AboutPage.tsx, find the final button that says 'Start your comeback story' and change the text to 'Get My AI Photographer'. Keep all existing styling, className, and onClick functionality exactly the same."
```

1. Sandra started by teaching selfie techniques
2. Women couldn't execute the techniques properly  
3. Sandra realized they needed the photos, not the tips
4. She built AI to create perfect photos automatically
5. Now users get the results without the learning curve
