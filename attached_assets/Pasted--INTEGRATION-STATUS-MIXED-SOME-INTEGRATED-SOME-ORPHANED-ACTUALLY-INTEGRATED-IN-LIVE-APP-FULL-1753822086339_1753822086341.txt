‚úÖ INTEGRATION STATUS: MIXED - SOME INTEGRATED, SOME ORPHANED
ACTUALLY INTEGRATED IN LIVE APP:
‚úÖ FULLY INTEGRATED:

RachelChat - Line 32: import RachelChat from "@/pages/rachel-chat"; ‚úÖ ROUTED
RachelActivation - Line 33: import RachelActivation from "@/pages/rachel-activation"; ‚úÖ ROUTED
AdminConsultingAgents - Line 40: import AdminConsultingAgents from "@/pages/admin-consulting-agents"; ‚úÖ ROUTED
CREATED BUT NOT INTEGRATED (ORPHANED FILES):
‚ùå ORPHANED COMPONENTS:

LuxuryChatInterface.tsx - Component exists but NOT imported or used anywhere in App.tsx
dev-preview-modal.tsx - Component exists but NOT imported in App.tsx
TestImplementation.tsx - Component exists but NOT imported in App.tsx
ROUTING CHECK:
Let me check the actual routing definitions to see what's accessible:

‚úÖ FINAL INTEGRATION STATUS REPORT
ACTUAL LIVE APP ACCESS:
‚úÖ ACCESSIBLE ROUTES (Users can visit these URLs):

/rachel-chat ‚Üí Line 282: RachelChat component ‚úÖ LIVE
/rachel-activation ‚Üí Line 283: RachelActivation component ‚úÖ LIVE
/admin/consulting-agents ‚Üí Line 265: AdminConsultingAgents ‚úÖ LIVE
ORPHANED COMPONENTS (Exist but not accessible):
LuxuryChatInterface.tsx ‚ùå NOT IMPORTED, NOT ROUTED

üîÑ WEEK 2 WORKFLOW REALITY CHECK:
The Issue: Elena reported "85% completion" but this was component creation, not integration. Most Week 2 deliverables exist as files but aren't connected to the live platform.

What Users Actually Get:

Rachel's Conversational Flows ‚úÖ Working at /rachel-chat
Rachel Activation ‚úÖ Working at /rachel-activation
Admin Consulting Interface ‚úÖ Working at /admin/consulting-agents
Zara's Live Preview System ‚ùå Components exist but not integrated
Quinn's User Journey Testing ‚ùå Components exist but not integrated
üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:
The Week 2 workflow created components but didn't follow the mandatory 5-step integration protocol. This is exactly the orphaned file problem that was supposed to be prevented.
