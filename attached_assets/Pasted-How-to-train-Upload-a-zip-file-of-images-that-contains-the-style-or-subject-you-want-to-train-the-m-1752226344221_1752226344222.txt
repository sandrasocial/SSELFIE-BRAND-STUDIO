How to train:
Upload a zip file of images that contains the style or subject you want to train the model on.

Select a trigger_word that the model will learn to associate with your subject or style, and select subject or style as the type of fine-tuning you’re trying to run.

We’ll run an autocaptioning model on the input images that will generate captions which contain your trigger word. You can also provide your own captions. To do so, add a .txt file that contains a caption for each image you want to caption in the zip file you upload - for example, img_0.jpg would be captioned by img_0.txt.

For Destination select/create an empty Replicate model location to store your LoRAs.

Dataset Size and Image Resolution
Aim for a dataset of 10-20 images of your subject
Images with resolutions around 1024x1024 are ideal
Very large images will be scaled down to fit aspect ratios around 1024 resolutions
Image selection
For style LoRAs select images that highlight distinctive features of the style, use varied subjects but keep the style consistent
For style LoRAs avoid datasets where certain elements dominate
For character LoRAs use images of the subject in different settings, facial expressions, and backgrounds.
For character LoRAs avoid different haircuts or ages, and showing hands in a lot of face framing positions as we found this led to more hand hallucinations
How to Run your Flux fine tune
After training is complete you will be able to run your LoRA in a new Replicate model at the destination location. You can then use it to generate images by including your trigger word in prompts, i.e. A photo of <trigger_word> in the forest.

How to train with the API
To run a training from the API, you’ll still need to gather a zip file of images and select or create a model on Replicate as the destination for your training. Unlike in the UI, you’ll also need to upload the zip file to your storage platform of choice. You’ll also need to get a Replicate API token.

Once you have those things ready, you can call the training API like so:

curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "destination": "your-username/your-model-name",
        "input": {
            "input_images": "<your-training-data-url>",
            "trigger_word": "<some-unique-string>",
            "lora_type": "subject"
        }
    }' \

Copy
This will start the training and return a JSON with training metadata. You can check on the status of the training at replicate.com/trainings or programmatically through the API like so:

curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
