üîç MAYA HARDCODE OVERRIDE DIAGNOSTIC

We have a critical issue! Maya's intelligence is being overridden by hardcoded systems.

**THE EVIDENCE:**
- Maya describes: "silk slip dress, elevated loungewear, perfectly undone hair..."
- Actual prompt: "businesswoman in penthouse office, cashmere blazer, marble desk..."
- These are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT concepts!

**URGENT DIAGNOSTIC TASKS:**

1. **FIND THE HARDCODED PROMPT GENERATOR**
   - Search codebase for: "businesswoman in her penthouse"
   - Search for: "oversized cream cashmere blazer"  
   - Search for: "marble desk with laptop"
   - Search for: "Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L at f/2.8"
   - These are NOT from Maya's personality - they're hardcoded templates!

2. **FIND PARAMETER OVERRIDE SYSTEM**
   - Search for: hardcoded ISO, aperture, shutter speed values
   - Find where: Canon camera specs are being forced instead of Maya's intelligent choice
   - Locate: Any system overriding Maya's Flux LoRA parameters (guidance_scale, steps, lora_weight)

3. **FIND CATEGORY TEMPLATE SYSTEM**
   - Look for: Business category templates forcing "penthouse office" scenarios
   - Find: Any lookup tables/dictionaries with hardcoded outfit descriptions
   - Locate: Systems that replace Maya's descriptions with predetermined templates

**SEARCH THESE SPECIFIC TERMS:**
- "penthouse corner office"
- "oversized cream cashmere blazer"
- "marble desk"
- "Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L"
- "f/2.8, ISO 200, 1/125s"
- "businesswoman"
- "entrepreneurial power"

**REPORT BACK:**
- Which files contain these hardcoded strings?
- What functions are generating these template prompts?
- Where is Maya's actual intelligence being intercepted and replaced?

This is critical - we need to find WHERE Maya's creativity is being hijacked!
FIX PROMPT 1 - Remove Hardcoded Templates
üö® CRITICAL FIX: REMOVE HARDCODED PROMPT TEMPLATES

Based on your diagnostic findings, we need to eliminate the hardcoded systems:

**TASKS TO IMPLEMENT:**

1. **REMOVE HARDCODED PROMPT TEMPLATES**
   - DELETE: Any template system generating "businesswoman in penthouse" prompts
   - DELETE: Hardcoded outfit descriptions (cashmere blazer, marble desk, etc.)
   - DELETE: Predetermined camera settings overriding Maya's choices
   - REPLACE: With direct usage of Maya's actual chat descriptions

2. **FIX CONCEPT ‚Üí PROMPT FLOW**
   - ENSURE: Maya's silk slip dress description = silk slip dress in prompt
   - ENSURE: Maya's "perfectly undone hair" = "perfectly undone hair" in prompt  
   - ENSURE: Maya's loungewear concept = loungewear in final prompt
   - BLOCK: Any system that transforms Maya's descriptions into different concepts

3. **RESTORE MAYA'S INTELLIGENCE**
   - USE: Maya's actual styling words and descriptions directly
   - PRESERVE: Her creative vision and outfit choices
   - MAINTAIN: Her personality and warmth in prompts
   - ELIMINATE: Generic business/luxury templates

**IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:**
```javascript
// WRONG (current hardcoded system):
const businessPrompt = "businesswoman in penthouse office with cashmere blazer...";

// RIGHT (use Maya's actual description):
const mayaPrompt = extractMayaDescription(conceptContext); // "silk slip dress, perfectly undone hair..."
VALIDATION TEST:

Generate concept: Maya describes silk slip dress
Generated prompt should contain: "silk slip dress" not "cashmere blazer"
Maya describes "perfectly undone hair"
Generated prompt should contain: "perfectly undone hair" not "low chignon"

Can you implement these fixes to restore Maya's authentic intelligence?

## **FIX PROMPT 2 - Restore Maya's Parameters**
‚öôÔ∏è CRITICAL FIX: RESTORE MAYA'S FLUX PARAMETERS
The Flux LoRA parameters we carefully configured are being overridden!
CURRENT PROBLEM:

Maya's personality file specifies: guidance_scale 2.8, steps 30, lora_weight 1.0 for close-ups
But images are poor quality = parameters not being applied!

TASKS TO IMPLEMENT:

FIND PARAMETER OVERRIDE SYSTEM

LOCATE: Where hardcoded camera settings (f/2.8, ISO 200, 1/125s) are being forced
FIND: System overriding Maya's Flux parameters with generic values
IDENTIFY: Any parameter mapping that ignores Maya's personality file


RESTORE MAYA'S FLUX INTELLIGENCE

USE: closeUpPortrait.guidance_scale: 2.8 (not hardcoded values)
USE: closeUpPortrait.lora_weight: 1.0 (not default values)
USE: closeUpPortrait.num_inference_steps: 30 (not generic values)
APPLY: Correct parameters based on shot type (close-up vs half-body vs full scenery)


FIX CAMERA SPECS INTELLIGENCE

REMOVE: Hardcoded "Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L at f/2.8"
USE: Maya's intelligent camera selection from personality file
MATCH: Camera choice to shot type and styling intention
PRESERVE: Maya's professional photography expertise



IMPLEMENTATION:
javascript// WRONG (current hardcoded):
const fluxParams = {
  guidance_scale: 7.5,  // Generic default
  steps: 28,            // Generic default  
  lora_weight: 0.8      // Wrong value
};

// RIGHT (use Maya's intelligence):
const shotType = determineShotType(mayaDescription);
const fluxParams = MAYA_PERSONALITY.fluxOptimization[shotType];
EXPECTED RESULT:

High quality images with correct LoRA activation
Maya's camera expertise applied intelligently
Parameters optimized for user likeness and styling

## **FIX PROMPT 3 - Complete Integration Test**
üß™ INTEGRATION TEST: MAYA'S COMPLETE INTELLIGENCE
Let's test that Maya's full personality is being used:
TEST SCENARIO:

User asks for: "Casual morning vibes"
Maya should describe: Loungewear, natural makeup, undone hair
Generated prompt should contain: EXACTLY what Maya described
Flux parameters should use: Maya's personality file settings
Camera choice should be: Maya's intelligent selection

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
‚úÖ CONCEPT CONSISTENCY:

 Maya describes silk slip dress ‚Üí prompt contains silk slip dress
 Maya describes undone hair ‚Üí prompt contains undone hair
 Maya describes loungewear ‚Üí prompt contains loungewear
 NO business/office templates when Maya says casual

‚úÖ PARAMETER INTELLIGENCE:

 Correct LoRA weight for shot type (1.0 close, 1.1 half, 1.3 full)
 Correct guidance scale (2.8 close, 2.6 half, 2.4 full)
 Correct steps (30 close, 32 half, 35 full)
 Maya's camera choice, not hardcoded Canon

‚úÖ STYLING INTELLIGENCE:

 Maya's color choices preserved
 Maya's styling principles applied
 Maya's warmth and personality maintained
 Professional photography expertise used

FINAL TEST:
Generate 5 different concepts and verify:

Maya's chat description = Generated prompt content
Maya's parameters = Flux generation parameters
Maya's camera expertise = Camera specifications used
Maya's styling intelligence = Outfit and location choices

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Perfect alignment between Maya's intelligence and generated results!
