# Flux Dev LoRA - Optimal Settings & Default Prompt

## **RECOMMENDED TECHNICAL SETTINGS**

### **Core Generation Settings:**
```
Model: black-forest-labs/flux-dev-lora
LoRA Scale: 0.8 - 1.0 (start with 0.9)
Guidance: 2.5 - 2.8 (sweet spot: 2.6)
Steps: 35 - 50 (recommended: 40)
Aspect Ratio: 3:4 (most natural for portraits)
Scheduler: Beta (if available)
Sampler: dpmpp_2m (if available)
```

### **Why These Settings:**
- **LoRA Scale 0.9**: Strong enough to capture trained features without over-fitting
- **Guidance 2.6**: Balances prompt following with natural generation
- **Steps 40**: Enough detail without diminishing returns
- **Aspect Ratio 3:4**: Most natural for portrait work

## **DEFAULT REALISM PROMPT STRUCTURE**

### **Base Prompt Template:**
```
raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, unretouched natural skin texture, subsurface scattering, photographed on film, [TRIGGERWORD], [MAIN_DESCRIPTION], shot on [CAMERA] with [LENS], [LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION], natural expression, [STYLING_DETAILS]
```

### **Enhanced Default Prompt:**
```
raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, unretouched natural skin texture, subsurface scattering, photographed on film, [TRIGGERWORD], professional portrait photography, natural lighting, authentic skin texture, unprocessed natural beauty, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 85mm f/1.4 lens, natural expression, minimal makeup highlighting natural features
```

## **CRITICAL REALISM ELEMENTS**

### **Always Include These Terms:**
- `raw photo` - Prevents over-processing
- `visible skin pores` - Adds texture realism
- `film grain` - Natural photographic quality
- `unretouched natural skin texture` - Prevents AI smoothing
- `subsurface scattering` - Realistic skin light interaction
- `photographed on film` - Authentic photographic feel

### **Camera/Lens Specifications:**
**Most Realistic Results:**
- Canon EOS R5 with 85mm f/1.4 lens (portrait standard)
- Sony A7R IV with 50mm f/1.2 lens (natural perspective)
- Leica Q2 with 28mm f/1.7 lens (editorial quality)
- Fujifilm GFX 100S with 63mm f/2.8 lens (medium format quality)

### **Lighting Descriptions:**
**Natural Options:**
- `natural window lighting`
- `soft natural light`
- `golden hour lighting`
- `overcast natural lighting`
- `morning light streaming through windows`

**Studio Options:**
- `professional studio lighting`
- `soft diffused lighting`
- `beauty lighting with softbox`
- `natural portrait lighting`

## **WHAT TO AVOID**

### **Terms That Reduce Realism:**
❌ `digital art`  
❌ `illustration`  
❌ `anime`  
❌ `cartoon`  
❌ `perfect skin`  
❌ `flawless`  
❌ `HDR`  
❌ `oversaturated`  
❌ `digital painting`  

### **Over-Styling That Hurts Realism:**
❌ `glamour photography` (too processed)  
❌ `high fashion editorial` (unless specifically wanted)  
❌ `dramatic makeup` (can look artificial)  
❌ `perfect lighting` (too artificial)

## **TRIGGER WORD OPTIMIZATION**

### **Best Practices:**
- **Placement**: Always put trigger word early in prompt
- **Consistency**: Use exact same trigger word from training
- **Frequency**: Use once per prompt (don't repeat)
- **Context**: Let other descriptors flow naturally around it

### **Example Structure:**
```
raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, [TRIGGERWORD], woman in cream sweater sitting by window, natural morning light, authentic expression, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 85mm f/1.4 lens
```

---

## **TESTING OPTIMIZATION**

### **A/B Testing Framework:**
1. **Baseline**: Use default prompt with minimal description
2. **Test Variables**: One at a time
   - LoRA scale (0.8 vs 0.9 vs 1.0)
   - Guidance (2.5 vs 2.6 vs 2.8)
   - Steps (35 vs 40 vs 50)
3. **Measure**: Facial accuracy, skin realism, overall quality

### **Quality Checkpoints:**
✅ **Facial Recognition**: Does it look like the trained person?  
✅ **Skin Texture**: Natural pores and texture visible?  
✅ **Expression**: Natural, not forced or artificial?  
✅ **Lighting**: Believable and natural?  
✅ **Overall**: Could this be a real photograph?

## **RECOMMENDED DEFAULT PROMPT**

### **For General Use:**
```
raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, unretouched natural skin texture, subsurface scattering, photographed on film, [TRIGGERWORD], natural portrait, soft natural lighting, authentic expression, minimal makeup highlighting natural features, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 85mm f/1.4 lens, professional portrait photography
```

### **For Specific Scenarios:**
```
raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, unretouched natural skin texture, subsurface scattering, photographed on film, [TRIGGERWORD], [SPECIFIC_SCENARIO], natural lighting, authentic expression, shot on [CAMERA_SPEC], [MOOD_DESCRIPTION]
```

---

## **ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION TIPS**

### **Negative Prompts (if supported):**
```
cartoon, anime, digital art, illustration, painting, rendered, CGI, artificial, plastic skin, oversaturated, HDR, perfect skin, flawless, fake, unrealistic
```

### **Seed Consistency:**
- Use same seed for A/B testing
- Save successful seeds for similar shots
- Random seeds for variety in final generation

### **Batch Testing:**
- Generate 4-8 images per prompt
- Pick best result from batch
- Note which settings produced the winner

## **FINAL RECOMMENDED SETUP**

```javascript
const defaultSettings = {
  model: "black-forest-labs/flux-dev-lora",
  lora_scale: 0.9,
  guidance: 2.6,
  num_inference_steps: 40,
  aspect_ratio: "3:4",
  prompt: `raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, unretouched natural skin texture, subsurface scattering, photographed on film, ${userTriggerWord}, natural portrait, soft natural lighting, authentic expression, minimal makeup highlighting natural features, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 85mm f/1.4 lens, professional portrait photography`
};
```

This setup will give you maximum realism while maintaining strong similarity to your trained model. Start here and adjust based on your specific results!
