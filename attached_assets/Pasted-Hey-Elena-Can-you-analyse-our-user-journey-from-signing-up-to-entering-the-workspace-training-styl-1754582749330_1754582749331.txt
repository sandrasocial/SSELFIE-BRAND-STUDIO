Hey Elena, Can you analyse our user journey from signing up to entering the workspace training, style, shoot, build (step 1-4) gallery and flatlay library and create a strategy for what needs to be done before launch?

Elena's Strategic Analysis
📋 Current Status: Based on my thorough codebase analysis, we're starting from ground zero with our user journey implementation. This is actually good news because it means we can build it right from the start!

✅ Completed Elements:

Basic project structure (client/server architecture)
Documentation and development guidelines
Agent intelligence system for development
🔍 Critical Gaps: Here's what we need to build for our complete user journey:

Authentication Flow

Signup page with email verification
Login page
Password recovery system
User profile setup
Workspace & Training (Step 1)

Welcome/onboarding dashboard
Interactive tutorial system
Training modules interface
Progress tracking system
Style Journey (Step 2)

Style quiz/assessment
Style profile builder
Personalization settings
Style preferences storage
Shoot Setup (Step 3)

Camera setup guide
Lighting recommendations
Pose library
Shot planning tools
Build Interface (Step 4)

Flatlay composition tool
Image upload system
Edit/customize features
Save/export functionality
Gallery & Library

Personal gallery view
Flatlay library organization
Search and filter system
Sharing capabilities
🎯 Recommended Workflow:

Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)

Set up authentication system
Create database schemas
Implement user management
Build basic navigation structure
Phase 2: Core Journey (3 weeks)

Develop training module framework
Create style assessment system
Build basic shoot planning tools
Implement initial build interface
Phase 3: Advanced Features (2 weeks)

Enhanced flatlay tools
Gallery organization
Search functionality
Social sharing features
Phase 4: Polish & Launch (1 week)

UI/UX refinement
Performance optimization
Testing and bug fixes
Launch preparation
⏱️ Timeline Estimate: 8 weeks total for MVP launch

Strategic Recommendations:

Start with authentication and user management as they're foundational
Build features incrementally, focusing on core functionality first
Implement a basic version of each step before adding advanced features
Use consistent design patterns across all interfaces
Integrate analytics from the start to track user progress
