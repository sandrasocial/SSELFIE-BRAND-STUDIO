## Basic model info

Model name: black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro-ultra
Model description: FLUX1.1 [pro] in ultra and raw modes. Images are up to 4 megapixels. Use raw mode for realism.


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Text prompt for image generation (string)
- image_prompt (optional): Image to use with Flux Redux. This is used together with the text prompt to guide the generation towards the composition of the image_prompt. Must be jpeg, png, gif, or webp. (string)
- image_prompt_strength (optional): Blend between the prompt and the image prompt. (number)
- aspect_ratio (optional): Aspect ratio for the generated image (string)
- safety_tolerance (optional): Safety tolerance, 1 is most strict and 6 is most permissive (integer)
- seed (optional): Random seed. Set for reproducible generation (integer)
- raw (optional): Generate less processed, more natural-looking images (boolean)
- output_format (optional): Format of the output images. (string)


## Model output schema

{
  "type": "string",
  "title": "Output",
  "format": "uri"
}

If the input or output schema includes a format of URI, it is referring to a file.

## Model readme

> ## About
> 
> A new high-resolution capabilities to FLUX1.1 [pro], extending its functionality to support 4x higher image resolutions (up to 4MP) while maintaining an impressive generation time of only 10 seconds per sample.
> 
> ## Higher Resolution, No Compromise in Speed
> 
> FLUX1.1 [pro] – ultra mode: This option enables image generation at four times the resolution of standard FLUX1.1 [pro], without sacrificing prompt adherence. Unlike many high-resolution models that experience significant slowdowns at higher resolutions, our performance benchmarks show sustained fast generation times—over 2.5x faster than comparable high-resolution offerings. This model is available at a competitive price of $0.06 per image.
> 
> ## Raw Mode
> 
> FLUX1.1 [pro] – raw mode: For creators seeking authenticity, our new raw mode captures the genuine feel of candid photography. Toggle this feature to generate images with a less synthetic, more natural aesthetic. Compared to other text-to-image models, raw mode significantly increases diversity in human subjects and enhances the realism of nature photography
