🚨 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE CONFLICT - JULY 16, 2025
CONFLICTING DOCUMENTATION FOUND
Two Contradictory Architecture Documents:
CORE_ARCHITECTURE_IMMUTABLE.md (V1):

Uses: black-forest-labs/flux-dev-lora + lora_weights parameter
Says individual model versions are "WRONG approach"
Forbids using individual model versions directly
CORE_ARCHITECTURE_IMMUTABLE_V2.md (V2):

Uses: sandrasocial/{userId}-selfie-lora:{versionId} individual models
Says NO shared models, NO base model + LoRA approach
Requires individual trained model versions ONLY
Current System Implementation:
✅ ai-service.ts: Uses V2 approach (individual models)
✅ image-generation-service.ts: Uses V2 approach (individual models)
✅ routes.ts: JUST FIXED to use V2 approach (individual models)
Database Reality:
Users have individual trained models like:

sandrasocial/45038279-selfie-lora:f29c5c6b...
sandrasocial/45075281-selfie-lora:f69d18eb...
sandrasocial/42585527-selfie-lora:b9fab7ab...
Working System Evidence:
Logs show: "🔒 ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION: Maya AI Generation - Using correct FLUX individual model architecture"
Users successfully generating images with individual models
No lora_weights parameter usage found anywhere in current code
CRITICAL QUESTION FOR USER:
Which architecture should be enforced system-wide?

Option A - V1 (Base Model + LoRA):

{
  "version": "black-forest-labs/flux-dev-lora:a53fd...",
  "input": {
    "lora_weights": "sandrasocial/{userId}-selfie-lora:version",
    "lora_scale": 1.0,
    "prompt": "..."
  }
}
Option B - V2 (Individual Models):

{
  "version": "sandrasocial/{userId}-selfie-lora:{versionId}",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "...",
    "guidance": 2.8,
    "num_inference_steps": 35
  }
}
RECOMMENDATION:
Continue with V2 approach because:

Currently working and generating quality images
Better user isolation and privacy
Matches existing database structure
User reported V2 fixes quality issues
IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED: User must clarify which architecture to enforce across the entire system.
