Sandra´s Story: "Okay, here's what actually happened..."
One year ago my marriage ended. Single mom, three kids, zero plan.

But I had a phone. And I figured out that was all I needed.

90 days later: 120K followers. Today: A business that actually works. Now: Teaching you exactly how I did it.

No fancy equipment. No design degree. Just strategy that actually works.

"Your mess is your message. Let's turn it into money."
Let's build something real together...

Sandras Story: THE ORIGIN STORY

This didn’t start as a business.
It started as survival.

One year ago, I hit rock bottom.
Divorced. Three kids. No backup plan.
I was heartbroken, exhausted, and completely disconnected from the woman I used to be.

I didn’t recognize myself.
Not in the mirror. Not in my life.

And one day, in the middle of all that mess—I picked up my phone. Took a selfie. Posted something honest. Not perfect. Just true.

That one moment sparked something.
I didn’t need a full plan. I needed one brave post. One real story. One step back to myself.

From there, I kept showing up—camera in one hand, coffee in the other. And over time, I built a real audience, a real brand, and eventually, a real business.

Not because I had it all together. But because I didn’t—and I stopped hiding that.

That’s where SSELFIE was born.
From one woman deciding to stop shrinking and start showing up.

Now? I help other women do the same.

SSELFIE isn’t just about pictures.
It’s about power.
It’s about building something from the version of you that almost gave up—but didn’t.

Because when you show up as her?
Everything changes. No m-dashes, No emojis, no icons EVER
