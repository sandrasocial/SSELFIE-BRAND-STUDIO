## Basic model info

Model name: black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro
Model description: Faster, better FLUX Pro. Text-to-image model with excellent image quality, prompt adherence, and output diversity.


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Text prompt for image generation (string)
- image_prompt (optional): Image to use with Flux Redux. This is used together with the text prompt to guide the generation towards the composition of the image_prompt. Must be jpeg, png, gif, or webp. (string)
- aspect_ratio (optional): Aspect ratio for the generated image (string)
- width (optional): Width of the generated image in text-to-image mode. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 32 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 32). Note: Ignored in img2img and inpainting modes. (integer)
- height (optional): Height of the generated image in text-to-image mode. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 32 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 32). Note: Ignored in img2img and inpainting modes. (integer)
- safety_tolerance (optional): Safety tolerance, 1 is most strict and 6 is most permissive (integer)
- seed (optional): Random seed. Set for reproducible generation (integer)
- prompt_upsampling (optional): Automatically modify the prompt for more creative generation (boolean)
- output_format (optional): Format of the output images. (string)
- output_quality (optional): Quality when saving the output images, from 0 to 100. 100 is best quality, 0 is lowest quality. Not relevant for .png outputs (integer)


## Model output schema

{
  "type": "string",
  "title": "Output",
  "format": "uri"
}

If the input or output schema includes a format of URI, it is referring to a file.

## Model readme

> **FLUX1.1 [pro]** provides six times faster generation than its predecessor [FLUX.1 [pro]](https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-pro) while also improving image quality, prompt adherence, and diversity.
> 
> * Superior Speed and Efficiency: Faster generation times and reduced latency, enabling more efficient workflows. FLUX1.1 [pro] provides an ideal tradeoff between image quality and inference speed.
> * Improved Performance: FLUX1.1 [pro] has been introduced and tested under the codename "blueberry" into the [Artificial Analysis image arena](https://artificialanalysis.ai/text-to-image/arena), a popular benchmark for text-to-image models. It surpasses all other models on the leaderboard, achieving the highest overall Elo score.

> All public FLUX.1 models are based on a hybrid architecture of [multimodal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03206) and [parallel diffusion transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442) blocks and scaled to 12B parameters. We improve over previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by building on [flow matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747), a general and conceptually simple method for training generative models, which includes diffusion as a special case. In addition, we increase model performance and improve hardware efficiency by incorporating [rotary positional embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) and [parallel attention layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442).
