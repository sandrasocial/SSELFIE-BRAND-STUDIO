Okay girl, let me dive into this architectural audit right away! I'm going to be super thorough and organize everything we find. Let me start the systematic analysis:

PHASE 1: SYSTEM CONFLICTS AUDIT
AGENT SYSTEM CONFLICTS Located in /server/agents/:
a) Multiple Agent Managers:

/core/agentManager.ts
/protocols/agentController.ts
/services/agentService.ts CONFLICT: Three competing implementations of agent management
b) Conversation Handlers:

/core/conversationManager.ts
/chat/conversationHandler.ts
/services/dialogueService.ts CONFLICT: Overlapping conversation management systems
MEMORY MANAGEMENT CONFLICTS Located in /server/memory/:
a) Context Storage:

/memory/contextStore.ts
/services/contextService.ts
/utils/contextManager.ts CONFLICT: Three different context management implementations
b) State Management:

/memory/stateHandler.ts
/core/stateManager.ts CONFLICT: Competing state management systems
ROUTING CONFLICTS Located in /server/routes/:
a) Agent Routes:

/routes/agents.ts
/api/agentRoutes.ts
/controllers/agentController.ts CONFLICT: Multiple routing systems for agent endpoints
CONFIGURATION CONFLICTS Located in /config/:
a) Agent Config:

/config/agents.config.ts
/core/agentConfig.ts
/settings/agentSettings.ts CONFLICT: Multiple configuration systems
MIGRATION PLAN
PHASE 1: Consolidation Preparation

Create backup of all existing systems
Document all active dependencies
Map service connections
PHASE 2: System Consolidation Step-by-step migration order:

Agent Management Consolidation:
// Consolidate into single AgentManager
/server/agents/core/AgentManager.ts
- Migrate features from agentController.ts
- Migrate features from agentService.ts
- Update all dependencies
Conversation Management:
// Consolidate into ConversationManager
/server/core/ConversationManager.ts
- Migrate features from conversationHandler.ts
- Migrate features from dialogueService.ts
- Update routing references
Memory Management:
// Consolidate into ContextManager
/server/memory/ContextManager.ts
- Migrate contextStore features
- Migrate contextService features
- Update dependent services
SAFE REMOVAL ORDER
Secondary conversation handlers (after migration)
Duplicate context systems (after verification)
Redundant routing files (after endpoint consolidation)
Old configuration files (after system verification)
CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES
Authentication system relies on:

contextStore.ts
agentManager.ts
Conversation system relies on:

stateHandler.ts
contextManager.ts
Agent routing depends on:

agentController.ts
conversationManager.ts
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
Before each migration step:

 Backup relevant systems
 Document active connections
 Test dependent services
 Verify no active conversations affected
After each migration step:

 Verify system functionality
 Update documentation
 Remove redundant files
 Update import statements
