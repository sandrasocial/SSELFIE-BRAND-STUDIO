PHASE 1: Route Consolidation and Database Migration
PHASE 1: Critical Infrastructure Cleanup
OBJECTIVE: Consolidate duplicate routes and complete database migration
PRIORITY: High - Required for launch stability

SPECIFIC TASKS:

1. ROUTE CONSOLIDATION:
   a) In App.tsx or main routing file:
      - Ensure /ai-training redirects to /simple-training
      - Ensure /gallery redirects to /sselfie-gallery  
      - Ensure /studio redirects to /workspace
      - Remove any duplicate route definitions

   b) Test redirects work properly:
      - Navigate to /ai-training → should redirect to /simple-training
      - Navigate to /gallery → should redirect to /sselfie-gallery
      - Navigate to /studio → should redirect to /workspace

2. DATABASE MIGRATION (aiImages → generatedImages):
   a) Verify generatedImages table has all required fields:
      - userId, category, subcategory, prompt, imageUrls, selectedUrl, saved
   
   b) Create migration script to:
      - Copy data from aiImages to generatedImages where missing
      - Ensure no data loss during migration
      - Keep aiImages table intact as backup

   c) Update API endpoints to use generatedImages:
      - /api/gallery-images should query generatedImages table
      - /api/ai-images should query generatedImages table
      - Maintain backwards compatibility

3. TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
   - Complete user journey test: Landing → Training → Maya → Gallery
   - Verify gallery displays all user images correctly
   - Confirm image saving from Maya chat works
   - Test image deletion functionality
   - Check mobile gallery functionality

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not modify core Maya AI functionality
- Do not change payment processing
- Do not alter training system logic
- Maintain all existing user data

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Clean route structure with proper redirects
- Unified database schema using generatedImages
- All existing functionality preserved
- No user-facing changes or disruptions

Complete Phase 1 fully and test before requesting Phase 2.
