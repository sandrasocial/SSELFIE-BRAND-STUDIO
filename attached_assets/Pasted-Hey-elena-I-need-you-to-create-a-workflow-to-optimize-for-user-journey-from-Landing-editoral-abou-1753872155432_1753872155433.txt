Hey elena, I need you to create a workflow to optimize for user journey, from Landing editoral, about, priceing, how it works, blog, login After login (members) workspace, ai-training, maya, ai-photoshoot (not routed and needs to be routed corrctly in step 3 in workspace, step 4 build, (not done) gallery, flatlay-library and admin. These are the pages I use and are important. The agents need to know NOT to create new components but actually work on these pages directly when implementing

I'll analyze your current page structure and create an optimized user journey workflow. Let me first examine your existing pages to understand the current state.

Based on my comprehensive analysis of your codebase, I can see you have an extensive platform with most pages already built. Let me create a strategic user journey workflow optimization plan for your agent team.

Perfect! Now let me execute the workflow by coordinating with our specialized agents to implement these critical fixes. I'll start with the immediate routing issue and then coordinate the BUILD feature completion.

Let me first examine the current workspace routing to understand the ai-photoshoot routing issue:

Let me first examine the current workspace routing to understand the ai-photoshoot routing issue:

Great! I can see the routing is actually correctly set up in the workspace - Step 3 points to `/ai-photoshoot` and Step 4 points to `/build`. Let me check if these routes are properly configured in the main App.tsx:

Let me continue checking the routing to see all the routes and identify the BUILD page issue:

Let me continue checking the routing to see all the routes and identify the BUILD page issue:

Perfect! I can see the routing is properly set up. The issue is clear now - there's a `/build` route at line 235, but we need to check if the `Build` component is properly imported and implemented. Let me check the imports and find the BUILD page:
