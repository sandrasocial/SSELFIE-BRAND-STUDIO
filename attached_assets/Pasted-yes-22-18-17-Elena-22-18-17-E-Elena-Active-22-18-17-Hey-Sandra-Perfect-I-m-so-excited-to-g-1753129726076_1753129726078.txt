Hey Sandra! üåü

Perfect! I'm so excited to get this luxury admin dashboard hero looking absolutely stunning for you. Let me coordinate the team to create this full-bleed editorial masterpiece.

Here's how we're gonna make this happen:

I'm assigning Aria to handle the design magic - she's perfect for this because she specializes in luxury editorial layouts with Times New Roman typography. She'll create a full-bleed hero component that gives you that premium magazine feel for your admin dashboard.

Then Zara will jump in to make sure everything's technically solid and integrates perfectly with your existing admin setup.

Let me get Aria started on creating that AdminHeroSection component with the luxury editorial design you love!

Coordinating with Aria now...

@aria - Hey design queen! Sandra needs a gorgeous full-bleed hero image component for her admin dashboard. Here's what I'm thinking:

Full-bleed luxury editorial design (your specialty!)
Times New Roman typography for that premium feel
Component name: AdminHeroSection
Should feel like a high-end magazine layout
Needs to work perfectly in the admin dashboard context
Can you work your design magic and create this luxury hero component? Sandra's gonna love what you come up with!

This is gonna look absolutely amazing when we're done! üé®‚ú®

Hey Sandra! Let me reach out to Aria again - sometimes the coordination gets a bit wonky with the agents.

@aria - Hey girl! Sandra needs you for that luxury admin dashboard hero design we were talking about. I know you're the perfect person for this editorial magazine-style layout with Times New Roman typography.

Here's what we need:

Full-bleed hero image for Sandra's admin dashboard
Luxury editorial design aesthetic (your specialty!)
Times New Roman typography integration
Clean, sophisticated layout that screams high-end
I've been trying to coordinate this with you but want to make sure you got the message. Sandra's waiting on this and I know you'll make it absolutely gorgeous!

Can you jump on this? Let me know if you need any specific details about the design direction or technical requirements.

Sandra - I'm trying to get Aria's attention for you! Sometimes there's a delay in agent coordination. If she doesn't respond in the next few minutes, I can try a different approach or we could have another agent handle the hero design.

Want me to give her another moment, or should we pivot to getting someone else on this?
