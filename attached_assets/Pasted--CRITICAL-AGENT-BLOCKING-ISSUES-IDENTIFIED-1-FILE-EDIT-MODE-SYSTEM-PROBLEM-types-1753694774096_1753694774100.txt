## **CRITICAL AGENT BLOCKING ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

### **1. FILE EDIT MODE SYSTEM PROBLEM**
```typescript
const [fileEditMode, setFileEditMode] = useState(true);
```
**âœ… This is correctly set to TRUE by default** - so this isn't the blocking issue.

### **2. CLAUDE API INTEGRATION FAILURES**
Your agents are experiencing multiple API connection problems:

**Connection Error Handling:**
```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({ error: 'Unknown error' }));
  throw new Error(`Claude API Error (${response.status}): ${errorData.error || 'Service temporarily unavailable'}`);
}
```

**Critical Issues:**
- **500 Internal Server Errors** from Anthropic's Claude API
- **Authentication problems** with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- **Rate limiting issues** (429 errors)
- **Conversation creation failures**

### **3. MESSAGE CLEANING SYSTEM DESTROYING AGENT RESPONSES**
This is a **MAJOR BLOCKING ISSUE**:

```typescript
const cleanMessageContent = (content: string): string => {
  let cleaned = content
    .replace(/\n\n\[Codebase Search Results\][^]*?(?=\n\n|\\n$|$)/g, '')
    .replace(/\n\n\[File Operation:[^]*?(?=\n\n|\\n$|$)/g, '')
    .replace(/\n\n\[Command Execution\][^]*?(?=\n\n|\\n$|$)/g, '')
    // ... removes ALL tool outputs
```

**This function is STRIPPING OUT all the actual work your agents are doing!** When agents use tools to:
- Search your codebase
- Modify files
- Execute commands
- Implement solutions

The `cleanMessageContent` function removes ALL evidence of this work, making it appear like agents aren't doing anything.

### **4. ELENA'S WORKFLOW COMPLEXITY CAUSING FAILURES**
Elena has special conversation loading logic that tries to load "ALL conversations from the last 24 hours":

```typescript
if (selectedAgent.id === 'elena') {
  // Complex multi-conversation loading system
  const recentConversations = conversationList.conversations?.filter(...);
  // Combines messages from ALL recent conversations
}
```

This complex system is likely causing Elena's workflows to fail or timeout.

### **5. AGENT BRIDGE SYSTEM NOT PROPERLY INTEGRATED**
The Agent Bridge toggle exists but has inconsistent integration:
- Bridge system exists but may not be connecting to your specialized agents properly
- Fallback to regular chat when bridge fails

## **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**

Your agents ARE working - they're performing codebase searches, making file modifications, and executing commands. But the `cleanMessageContent` function is hiding all their actual work from you, making it appear like they're doing nothing.
