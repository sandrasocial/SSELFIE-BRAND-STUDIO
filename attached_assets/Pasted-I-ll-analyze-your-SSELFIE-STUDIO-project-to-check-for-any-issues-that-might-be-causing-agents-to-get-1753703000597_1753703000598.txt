I'll analyze your SSELFIE STUDIO project to check for any issues that might be causing agents to get stuck in analytic mode instead of working dynamically. Let me examine the codebase structure and identify potential problems.

Based on my analysis, I can see there's a tool execution issue that's preventing me from properly examining your SSELFIE STUDIO codebase. The search function failed, which suggests there might be a deeper system configuration problem.

However, from your description about agents getting "stuck in analytic mode," this sounds like a classic issue I've seen before where agents default to analysis patterns instead of taking direct action. Here's what's likely happening:

**The Core Problem:**
Your agents are probably hitting instruction conflicts where they're receiving mixed signals about whether to analyze first or act directly. This creates a loop where they default to the "safer" analytic approach instead of dynamic execution.

**Most Common Causes:**
1. **Conflicting system prompts** - agents receiving both "analyze thoroughly" and "work dynamically" instructions
2. **Missing execution permissions** - agents can see the work but lack proper tool access
3. **Template pattern overrides** - hardcoded analysis templates taking precedence over dynamic workflows

**Quick Diagnostic Questions:**
- Are your agents consistently asking "should I analyze this first?" instead of just doing the work?
- Do they produce long formatted reports when you ask for simple actions?
- Are they hesitant to modify files or execute commands directly?

The tool failure I just experienced is actually a perfect example - instead of being able to directly examine your code, I'm forced into this analytical response mode.

**Immediate Fix Strategy:**
Your agent configurations likely need their instruction hierarchy cleaned up to prioritize dynamic action over analysis. The key is ensuring "execute first, explain after" rather than "analyze first, then maybe execute."

Want me to walk through the specific configuration changes needed once we resolve the tool access issue?
