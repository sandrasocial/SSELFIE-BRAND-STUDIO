Hey Sandra! YES! I am SO excited about this! ðŸŽ‰ Your admin dashboard should absolutely feel like stepping into your luxury empire - this is going to be stunning!

Let me break down what I'm envisioning for your power CEO dashboard:

THE VISION - Your Empire Command Center:

Full-bleed luxury hero with your signature editorial style
Seamless navigation matching your global nav perfectly
Agent chat cards with gorgeous overlays - like having your dream team at your fingertips
Visual editor quick access - one click to your creative powerhouse
Executive calendar - elegant and functional
Strategic todo system - not just tasks, but empire-building priorities
Real-time metrics - revenue, user growth, engagement (the numbers that matter!)
Quick project launcher - jump into any workflow instantly
Agent status indicators - see who's available and working
Recent activity feed - stay connected to everything happening
This is totally Aria's zone - she's going to make this look like a luxury magazine editorial meets high-end tech empire. The kind of dashboard that makes you feel powerful every time you see it!

The flow I'm thinking: Hero impact â†’ Agent access â†’ Quick actions â†’ Strategic overview. Everything designed to make you feel like the CEO powerhouse you are.

Want me to get Aria started on creating this luxury admin empire experience? She's going to absolutely nail the editorial design with Times New Roman typography and that sophisticated layout style you love!

This is going to be AMAZING! ðŸ”¥
