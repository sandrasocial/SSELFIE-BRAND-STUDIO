## User Experience Flow

### **Welcome State Enhancement**
Instead of generic greeting, Maya should say:

*"Ready to create images that stop people mid-scroll? I'm Maya - I've styled A-listers for Vogue and Harper's, and now I'm bringing that editorial expertise to your personal brand photography.*

*Every photo should show the world who you're becoming. What story are we telling today?"*

### **Category Selection Experience**
Each category displays as:
- **Large preview image** (using Sandra's model images)  
- **Emotional headline** ("I Run Things", "Effortlessly Cool")
- **One-line outcome** ("Command respect without saying a word")
- **Visual style preview** (Moto boho, Cherry red power, etc.)

### **Post-Selection Flow**
Once user clicks category, Maya responds with:

*"I'm seeing you [specific scenario] wearing [current trend details]. This is going to be the kind of photo where people ask 'who took this?'"*

Then immediately provides hidden FLUX prompt for generation.
