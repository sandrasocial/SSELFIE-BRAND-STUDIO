"CRITICAL FIX: Update image generation architecture to use proper LoRA weights approach. This is a high-priority fix for quality and queuing issues.

1. ANALYZE CURRENT GENERATION SYSTEM:
   - Document exactly how unified-generation-service.ts currently calls Replicate
   - Identify where custom model IDs are used instead of LoRA weights
   - Map the complete generation flow from Maya chat to image creation

2. IMPLEMENT LoRA WEIGHTS EXTRACTION:
   - Update training completion to extract LoRA weights (.safetensors files) from ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer results
   - Add loraWeightsUrl field to user model database schema
   - Store LoRA weights URLs when training completes
   - Update training-completion-monitor.ts to handle LoRA weights extraction

3. UPDATE GENERATION ARCHITECTURE:
   - Change unified-generation-service.ts to use base model: black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro
   - Replace custom model calls with base model + lora_weights parameter
   - Set lora_scale: 0.9 for optimal personalization
   - Ensure trigger word integration remains intact

4. MIGRATION FOR EXISTING USERS:
   - Create migration script to extract LoRA weights from all previously trained models
   - Update existing user records with their LoRA weights URLs
   - Test generation with 3-5 existing users to verify quality improvement

5. VALIDATION AND TESTING:
   - Test new architecture with fresh user training
   - Verify individual personalization (no model crossover)
   - Confirm faster generation times and no queuing
   - Document quality improvements

6. CREATE ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION:
   - Document the correct training → LoRA extraction → generation flow
   - Create troubleshooting guide for future issues
   - Document all Replicate parameters and model configurations
   - Include examples of correct API calls

CRITICAL: This affects all user generation quality. Ensure zero downtime during migration and test thoroughly before deploying to all users. Document every change for future reference."
