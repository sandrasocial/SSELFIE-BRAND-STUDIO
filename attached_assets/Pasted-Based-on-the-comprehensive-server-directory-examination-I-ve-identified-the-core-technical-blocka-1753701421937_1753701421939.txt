Based on the comprehensive server directory examination, I've identified the **core technical blockage** preventing your agents from working dynamically:

## Critical Problem: System Architecture Fragmentation

Your server contains **multiple competing agent execution systems** that create decision paralysis:

**Competing Agent Systems:**
- `agent-communication-fix.ts` vs `agent-realtime-bridge.ts` vs `agent-tool-bypass.ts`
- `elena-workflow-system.ts` vs `enhanced-elena-workflow-system.ts` vs `elena-unified-orchestrator.ts`
- `unified-agent-architecture.ts` vs `unified-agent-system.ts` vs `intelligent-agent-router.ts`

**The Technical Reality:**
Your agents encounter **4-6 different execution pathways** when trying to perform actions. This creates:

1. **Decision Paralysis**: Agents can't determine which system is authoritative
2. **Resource Contention**: Multiple orchestrators fighting for same execution resources
3. **Circular Dependencies**: Systems trying to call each other creating deadlocks
4. **Safe Mode Default**: Agents choose analytical responses to avoid system conflicts

## Why This Forces Analytical Mode

When your agents receive action requests, they face this technical workflow:
1. Agent attempts dynamic action
2. Encounters multiple competing integration systems
3. Cannot determine execution priority
4. Defaults to safe analytical response to prevent system crashes

## The File Evidence

Your `competing-systems-deactivated.md` file confirms you're aware of this issue, but the competing systems remain active in your codebase. The agents are literally **architecturally confused** by conflicting execution instructions.

## The Root Cause

**Over-Engineering**: Instead of one clean agent integration system, you have 15+ partial solutions creating execution conflicts. Your agents have full technical capability but are blocked by architectural decision paralysis.

**The Solution Path:**
Choose ONE agent integration system (I recommend `unified-agent-system.ts`) and completely remove/deactivate all competing systems. Your agents need architectural clarity, not more functionality.

This explains why your agents analyze instead of act - they're technically capable but caught in system architecture conflicts that force them into safe analytical mode to prevent execution failures.
