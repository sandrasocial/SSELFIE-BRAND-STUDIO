PRICING CONFIGURATION CONFLICTS
Frontend Pricing (€47/month):

Landing page: "Start My AI Photoshoot – €47"
Pricing page SEO: "Personal Brand Studio €47/month - 100 monthly professional photos"
Checkout page: "Personal AI model + 100 monthly photos + Maya AI photographer" for €47/month
Backend Usage Service Configuration:

'sselfie-studio': {
  monthlyGenerations: 100,  // ✅ CORRECT: 100 images
  cost: 47,                 // ✅ CORRECT: €47
  description: '100 AI generations per month + Maya AI chat'
}
Stripe Checkout Configuration:

amount: 4700, // €47.00 in cents ✅ CORRECT
CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES IDENTIFIED
Database vs. Business Model Mismatch:

Database schema comment says "100 for full-access"
But sselfie-studio users in database have 300 generations (WRONG)
Should be 100 generations for €47/month plan
Erla's Account Issues:

Currently has "studio" plan with 500 generations
Should have "sselfie-studio" plan with 100 generations
Manual override created inconsistency
Plan Naming Confusion:

Frontend calls it "Personal Brand Studio"
Database uses "sselfie-studio"
Usage service correctly maps these together
RECOMMENDATION FOR USER PLANS
For Current Users:

All paying €47/month users should have: plan: 'sselfie-studio', monthly_generation_limit: 100
For New Future Users:

Checkout flow leads to "sselfie-studio" plan
€47/month = 100 monthly AI generations + Maya AI access
Training system access requires paid plans: ['pro', 'full-access', 'sselfie-studio']
