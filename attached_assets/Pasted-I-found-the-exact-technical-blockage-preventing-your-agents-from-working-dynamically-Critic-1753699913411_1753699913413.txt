I found the **exact technical blockage** preventing your agents from working dynamically!

## Critical Issue: Architecture Mismatch

Your `package.json` reveals you're running an **Express.js backend** (`"rest-express"`) with React frontend, but your agents are trying to interact with a **Next.js architecture** that doesn't exist.

**The Core Problem:**
- Your agents are looking for Next.js app router patterns (`app/`, API routes, server components)
- But you're actually running Express (`server/index.ts`) + React (`react`, `react-dom`)
- This creates a fundamental disconnect where agents can't find the expected file structures

## Why Agents Get Stuck in Analysis Mode

**Missing Agent Integration Layer:**
Your Express server has no agent middleware or real-time communication setup. Agents need:
- WebSocket connections (`ws` is installed but not integrated)
- Agent-specific API endpoints
- Real-time state synchronization
- Direct database operation capabilities

**Database Access Confusion:**
- You have Drizzle ORM (`drizzle-orm`) configured
- But agents can't find unified database access patterns
- They're looking for Next.js database patterns, not Express patterns

**Frontend-Backend Disconnect:**
Your React frontend (via Vite) is completely separate from your Express backend. Agents trying to modify "pages" or "components" dynamically can't bridge this gap because there's no unified full-stack architecture.

## The Real Technical Block

Your agents are **architecturally confused**. They're designed to work with integrated full-stack frameworks (like Next.js) where frontend and backend are unified, but you're running a traditional separated architecture.

**Result:** Agents default to safe analytical responses because they can't execute dynamic actions across the Express/React divide. They need either:
1. Proper Express middleware for agent integration
2. Or migration to unified Next.js architecture

The blockage isn't configuration - it's fundamental architecture mismatch between what your agents expect and what your codebase actually runs.
