📦 Deliverables Requested from Agent

Please generate a comprehensive technical and product audit document to verify launch readiness. This document should include the following:

🔍 SECTION 1: USER JOURNEY VERIFICATION

Validate that all phases are fully implemented: Discovery, Authentication, Payment, Onboarding, Training, Styling (Maya), and Gallery.

Highlight any missing states, redirection issues, or user confusion points.

🔒 SECTION 2: SECURITY & DATA PRIVACY

Verify OAuth flow integrity with Replit OAuth

Check that payment details use secure endpoints and no PII is stored improperly

Ensure AWS S3 access is restricted and securely signed

Confirm no API keys are hardcoded; all secrets must be in Replit Secrets Manager

Ensure at least 10 selfies are required and validated before training starts

Confirm correct API usage for Replicate (LoRA model creation + progress polling)

Verify user-specific model creation and tracking via userModels table
