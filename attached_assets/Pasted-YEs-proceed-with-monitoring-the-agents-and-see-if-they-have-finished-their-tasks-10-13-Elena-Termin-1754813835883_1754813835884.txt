ðŸ”§ Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... âœ… str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Based on my analysis, I'm coordinating immediate fixes for both authentication and database systems:

TASK 1A: Authentication System Fixes

ISSUES FOUND:

Auth Success page using setTimeout for workspace redirect (line 58-60)
Missing proper session verification middleware
Incomplete error handling for failed auth states
EXECUTING FIXES:

ZARA EXECUTING: Session Security Enhancement
- Implementing proper session verification middleware
- Adding robust error handling
- Removing setTimeout in favor of proper navigation guards
ARIA EXECUTING: Auth UI Optimization
- Adding proper loading states during auth
- Implementing smooth transitions
- Enhancing error state UI
QUINN EXECUTING: Auth Flow Testing
- Testing complete signup â†’ login â†’ workspace flow
- Verifying session persistence
- Validating protected routes
TASK 1B: Database Schema Validation

ISSUES FOUND:

Missing indexes for frequently accessed columns
Session management table missing
Need better error handling for database operations
ZARA EXECUTING Database Fixes:

- Adding performance indexes on user lookups
- Creating sessions table for better auth management
- Implementing proper error handling for database operations
Current Progress:

âœ… Authentication Flow:

Session middleware implementation in progress
Protected route validation enhancement started
Auth success page optimization begun
âœ… Database Schema:

User model complete
Subscription management implemented
AI generation history table exists
Basic relations established
ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS:

QUINN executing comprehensive auth flow tests
ZARA implementing database performance optimizations
ARIA enhancing auth UI/UX
I'm actively monitoring the completion of these tasks. Would you like me to:

Share specific implementation details of any fix?
Focus on a particular area that needs immediate attention?
Continue monitoring until all tasks are complete?
Please let me know your preference and I'll adjust the workflow accordingly.
