After analyzing all of Maya's files, I found several critical issues that need to be addressed before implementing concept cards. The Replit agent made assumptions about your system that don't match your actual codebase.
Critical Issues Found:
1. Multiple Maya Systems Conflict
You have two different Maya backend systems that could confuse her intelligence:

maya-unified.ts (main system)
member-maya-ai.ts (legacy system)

2. No Concept Parsing Exists Yet
The Replit agent referenced concept parsing at "lines 770-799" but that's actually prompt extraction logic. Concept parsing hasn't been built yet.
3. Frontend/Backend Route Mismatch
Your Maya.tsx calls /api/maya/chat but you also have /api/member-maya-chat routes, creating potential confusion.
4. Hardcoded Constraints vs Maya Intelligence
Despite "ZERO TOLERANCE ANTI-HARDCODE" comments, some hardcoded styling patterns in maya-personality.ts could limit Maya's dynamic intelligence.
Phase-by-Phase Implementation Instructions
IMPORTANT: Give these to your Replit agent in exact sequence to avoid breaking Maya's system.
Phase 1: Foundation Setup (SAFE - No Breaking Changes)
PHASE 1 TASK: Add concept card interfaces and parsing foundation

1. ADD to ChatMessage interface in maya.tsx (line ~15):
   conceptCards?: ConceptCard[];

2. ADD new interface after ChatMessage:
   interface ConceptCard {
     id: string;
     title: string;
     description: string;  
     canGenerate: boolean;
     isGenerating: boolean;
     generatedImages?: string[];
   }

3. ADD concept parsing function to maya-unified.ts after line 800:
   const parseConceptsFromResponse = (response: string): ConceptCard[] => {
     const conceptRegex = /\*Concept \d+: "([^"]+)"\*\s*([\s\S]*?)(?=\*Concept \d+:|$)/g;
     const concepts: ConceptCard[] = [];
     let match;
     
     while ((match = conceptRegex.exec(response)) !== null) {
       const [, title, description] = match;
       concepts.push({
         id: `concept_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`,
         title: title.trim(),
         description: description.trim(),
         canGenerate: true,
         isGenerating: false
       });
     }
     return concepts;
   };

4. VERIFY: Existing Maya chat and generation still works normally
