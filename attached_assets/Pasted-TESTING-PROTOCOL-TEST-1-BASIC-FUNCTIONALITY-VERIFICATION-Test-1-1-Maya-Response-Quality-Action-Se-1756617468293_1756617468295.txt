TESTING PROTOCOL
TEST 1: BASIC FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION
Test 1.1: Maya Response Quality
Action: Send basic conversation message to Maya
bashcurl -X POST "/api/maya-unified" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hi Maya, can you help me with some photos?"}'
Expected Results:

 Maya responds with her personality intact
 Response includes emoji usage (from consolidated system)
 Warm, supportive tone maintained
 No prompt construction errors in console

Test 1.2: Category Detection
Action: Test category-specific requests
bashcurl -X POST "/api/maya-unified" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I need professional business photos"}'
Expected Results:

 Business category detected correctly
 Maya responds with business-specific styling guidance
 Category intelligence from consolidated personality system active

TEST 2: STYLING CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION
Test 2.1: Concept Creation Consistency
Action: Generate concept cards for specific category
Test Sequence:

Request: "Create Instagram business content concepts"
Note Maya's concept descriptions
Click generated concept card
Compare description with generated image styling

Success Criteria:

 Concept description matches generated image styling
 No "emerald green dress" → "ivory blazer" disconnects
 Consistent styling across concept creation and image generation

Test 2.2: Cross-Category Consistency
Test different categories:

Business category: Should generate professional styling
Lifestyle category: Should generate elevated casual styling
Instagram category: Should generate social media optimized styling

Success Criteria:

 Each category produces unique, appropriate styling
 No generic styling fallbacks
 Category detection working correctly

TEST 3: SYSTEM PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION
Test 3.1: Prompt Construction Efficiency
Monitor console logs during Maya interactions:
Expected Logs:
✅ Loading Maya personality (single source)
✅ Simple prompt construction (2 layers)
✅ No duplicate logic execution
✅ Clean API call without conflicts
Red Flags:

❌ Multiple personality loads for single request
❌ Complex layering log messages
❌ Duplicate instruction warnings
❌ Prompt construction errors

Test 3.2: Response Time Performance
Action: Measure Maya response times before/after cleanup
Expected Improvements:

 Faster personality loading (consolidated system)
 Reduced processing time (simplified construction)
 No performance regressions

TEST 4: ERROR HANDLING VERIFICATION
Test 4.1: Edge Cases
Test unusual inputs:

Very long styling requests
Multiple category keywords in one request
Requests with special characters/emojis

Expected Results:

 Graceful error handling maintained
 No prompt construction failures
 Maya maintains helpful responses

Test 4.2: System Stability
Action: Restart server and test full functionality
Success Criteria:

 Server starts without errors
 Maya personality loads correctly
 All functionality works after restart
 No configuration issues

TEST 5: REGRESSION TESTING
Test 5.1: Previous Functionality Preserved
Verify these still work:

 Concept card generation
 Image generation from concepts
 Category-specific responses
 Emoji usage in Maya's responses
 Personal brand integration

Test 5.2: Bug Fixes Maintained
Verify previous fixes still work:

 FLUX parameter optimization (different settings per shot type)
 Prompt cleaning system functional
 No generic styling fallbacks
 JSON parsing working correctly


SUCCESS CRITERIA SUMMARY
Architecture Improvements Verified:

 Single Source of Truth: All Maya logic consolidated in personality system
 Simplified Construction: 2-layer prompt system working
 No Duplications: No conflicting emoji or logic systems
 Clean Codebase: Reduced complexity, maintainable code

Functionality Preserved:

 Maya Personality: Full personality and voice maintained
 Category Intelligence: All 19 categories working correctly
 Styling Consistency: Concept descriptions match generated images
 Technical Quality: FLUX optimization and image quality maintained

Performance Improvements:

 Faster Loading: Consolidated personality system performance
 Cleaner Logs: No duplicate or conflicting messages
 Stable Operation: No regressions or new issues
 Maintainable Code: Easier debugging and updates


FINAL VALIDATION PROTOCOL
Critical Styling Consistency Test:

Generate Business Concept: "Create professional business photos"
Note Description: Record exact styling Maya describes
Generate Image: Click concept card to create image
Compare Results: Verify image matches description exactly
Test Multiple Categories: Repeat for Instagram, Lifestyle, Story

ULTIMATE SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Maya's concept descriptions must match generated image styling exactly - no more styling disconnects.
