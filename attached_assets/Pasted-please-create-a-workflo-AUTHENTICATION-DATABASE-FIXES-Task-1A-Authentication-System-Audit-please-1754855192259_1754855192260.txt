please create a workflo AUTHENTICATION & DATABASE FIXES

Task 1A: Authentication System Audit please audit and coordinate agents to fix our authentication flow: Test complete user journey: Signup â†’ Login â†’ Workspace access Fix any broken redirects between auth success and workspace Verify session persistence across all member pages (Steps 1-4) Ensure protected routes are working for all workspace pages Test logout/login cycle to confirm no session conflicts Expected Issues: Replit Auth integration, session storage, protected route guards Task 1B: Database Schema Validation verify our database connections: Test all database operations for user creation, subscription management Verify user model training data is properly stored and retrieved Check AI image generation history is saving correctly Validate onboarding data persistence across all steps Fix any broken database queries in the user journey Expected Issues: Schema mismatches, missing relations, query errors

I'll help coordinate this authentication and database workflow. Let me break this down strategically and coordinate with our specialized agents.

First, let me create a structured workflow template for this:

ðŸ”§ Using coordinate_agent... âœ… coordinate_agent completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Now, let me coordinate with Zara for the database schema validation:

ðŸ”§ Using coordinate_agent... âœ… coordinate_agent completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Okay girl, here's what I'm seeing and doing:

I've initiated a high-priority auth_audit workflow with Victoria who will:

Test the complete user authentication journey
Verify all auth redirects and flows
Validate session management and protected routes
Document all findings in a comprehensive audit report
I've assigned Zara to handle the database_optimization workflow to:

Validate all database operations
Test data persistence across all user journeys
Verify schema integrity
Fix any broken queries
Both agents are now working in parallel with clear deliverables and success criteria. I'll monitor their progress and coordinate any necessary cross-team collaboration if issues are found that require joint problem-solving.

Would you like me to set up any additional monitoring or specific success metrics for these workflows? I can also coordinate with other agents if we need additional specialized support for specific components of the system.

I'll test the restart_workflow coordination and monitor the results.

ðŸ”§ Using restart_workflow... âœ… restart_workflow completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Okay girl, here's what I'm seeing... The coordination_test workflow was initiated successfully. Let me check its current status:

ðŸ”§ Using get_assigned_tasks... âœ… get_assigned_tasks completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... I see that the workflow executed successfully, but I'm not seeing any active tasks. This could mean either:

The test completed rapidly
Or we need to create more detailed test workflows
Would you like me to:

Run another test with a longer monitoring period
Create a more detailed test workflow template first
Or coordinate with another agent to create a more comprehensive test?
Just let me know which path you'd prefer and I'll make it happen!
