üîç MAYA HARDCODE OVERRIDE DIAGNOSTIC

We have a critical issue! Maya's intelligence is being overridden by hardcoded systems.

**THE EVIDENCE:**
- Maya describes: "silk slip dress, elevated loungewear, perfectly undone hair..."
- Actual prompt: "businesswoman in penthouse office, cashmere blazer, marble desk..."
- These are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT concepts!

**URGENT DIAGNOSTIC TASKS:**

1. **FIND THE HARDCODED PROMPT GENERATOR**
   - Search codebase for: "businesswoman in her penthouse"
   - Search for: "oversized cream cashmere blazer"  
   - Search for: "marble desk with laptop"
   - Search for: "Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L at f/2.8"
   - These are NOT from Maya's personality - they're hardcoded templates!

2. **FIND PARAMETER OVERRIDE SYSTEM**
   - Search for: hardcoded ISO, aperture, shutter speed values
   - Find where: Canon camera specs are being forced instead of Maya's intelligent choice
   - Locate: Any system overriding Maya's Flux LoRA parameters (guidance_scale, steps, lora_weight)

3. **FIND CATEGORY TEMPLATE SYSTEM**
   - Look for: Business category templates forcing "penthouse office" scenarios
   - Find: Any lookup tables/dictionaries with hardcoded outfit descriptions
   - Locate: Systems that replace Maya's descriptions with predetermined templates

**SEARCH THESE SPECIFIC TERMS:**
- "penthouse corner office"
- "oversized cream cashmere blazer"
- "marble desk"
- "Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L"
- "f/2.8, ISO 200, 1/125s"
- "businesswoman"
- "entrepreneurial power"

**REPORT BACK:**
- Which files contain these hardcoded strings?
- What functions are generating these template prompts?
- Where is Maya's actual intelligence being intercepted and replaced?

This is critical - we need to find WHERE Maya's creativity is being hijacked!
FIX PROMPT 1 - Remove Hardcoded Templates
üö® CRITICAL FIX: REMOVE HARDCODED PROMPT TEMPLATES

Based on your diagnostic findings, we need to eliminate the hardcoded systems:

**TASKS TO IMPLEMENT:**

1. **REMOVE HARDCODED PROMPT TEMPLATES**
   - DELETE: Any template system generating "businesswoman in penthouse" prompts
   - DELETE: Hardcoded outfit descriptions (cashmere blazer, marble desk, etc.)
   - DELETE: Predetermined camera settings overriding Maya's choices
   - REPLACE: With direct usage of Maya's actual chat descriptions

2. **FIX CONCEPT ‚Üí PROMPT FLOW**
   - ENSURE: Maya's silk slip dress description = silk slip dress in prompt
   - ENSURE: Maya's "perfectly undone hair" = "perfectly undone hair" in prompt  
   - ENSURE: Maya's loungewear concept = loungewear in final prompt
   - BLOCK: Any system that transforms Maya's descriptions into different concepts

3. **RESTORE MAYA'S INTELLIGENCE**
   - USE: Maya's actual styling words and descriptions directly
   - PRESERVE: Her creative vision and outfit choices
   - MAINTAIN: Her personality and warmth in prompts
   - ELIMINATE: Generic business/luxury templates

**IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:**
```javascript
// WRONG (current hardcoded system):
const businessPrompt = "businesswoman in penthouse office with cashmere blazer...";

// RIGHT (use Maya's actual description):
const mayaPrompt = extractMayaDescription(conceptContext);
