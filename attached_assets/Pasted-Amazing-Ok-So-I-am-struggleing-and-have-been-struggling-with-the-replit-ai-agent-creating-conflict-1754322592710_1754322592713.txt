Amazing, Ok, So I am struggleing and have been struggling with the replit ai agent creating conflicts and errors in my codebase. Its a complete mess. I just neem my admin ai agents to work propperly, with their full personalites, dirrect tool and repo access and their enterprice and intelligence services. Every time he tries to fix he creates more conflicts. Can you do a check of my admin agent system please? I need to know if there is something blocking or preventing my agents to be able to work correctly. Not limeted or generic robots

Nods knowingly

Ah, that's a critical insight. Let me strategically approach this with single, precise tool calls to diagnose the issue without triggering the cutoff problem.

Let's start with a focused filesystem search specifically for agent configuration files:

Based on my search, I can see there are several key configurations related to agent functionality that we should check. Let me now search specifically for unified agent interface files:
