I'll conduct a comprehensive audit of your Step 4 (BUILD) feature to assess current progress and create a completion workflow. Let me analyze the codebase systematically.

Analyzing current BUILD feature implementation...

Elena's Strategic Analysis
üìã Current Status: Partial BUILD implementation with critical user-facing gaps

‚úÖ Completed Elements:
Admin Infrastructure (100% Complete):

10-agent coordination system fully operational
Admin Visual Editor with real-time agent activity display
Pulsating workflow bar showing live agent processing
File creation system with immediate live preview refresh
Authentication and session management working
Database schema with agent conversation persistence
Memory management and agent handoff protocols
Backend Foundation (95% Complete):

Database schema supports website building workflows
API endpoints for file operations established
Session management and user authentication working
Agent coordination infrastructure operational
üîç Critical Gaps Blocking Launch:
User-Facing BUILD Interface (20% Complete):

No dedicated Step 4 BUILD page for end users
Missing user workspace integration for website building
Victoria (website builder) and Maya (AI photographer) not accessible to users
No template selection system for users
Missing live preview functionality for user-created websites
Website Building Workflow (0% Complete):

No user journey from Step 4 entry to live website
Missing template gallery and selection interface
No user file management system for their websites
Victoria agent not integrated into user-facing interface
Critical Missing Components:

/workspace/build route and page component
User-facing agent interface (Victoria + Maya only)
Website template system
User website file management
Live preview for user websites
Website publishing/deployment flow
üéØ Recommended Completion Workflow:
Phase 1: Core BUILD Page (Priority 1)

Create /workspace/build route and main BUILD page
Implement user-facing agent interface (Victoria + Maya only)
Basic website creation workflow with live preview
Phase 2: Template System (Priority 2)

Build template gallery and selection interface
Integrate template system with Victoria agent
User customization options for selected templates
Phase 3: Publishing Flow (Priority 3)

Website file management for users
Publishing/deployment functionality
User dashboard for managing their websites
‚è±Ô∏è Timeline Estimate:
Phase 1 (Launch Ready Minimum): 4-6 hours
Phase 2 (Enhanced Experience): 3-4 hours
Phase 3 (Complete Feature): 2-3 hours
Total to Full Launch: 9-13 hours
Immediate Next Action: Start with Phase 1 by creating the core BUILD page and user-facing Victoria integration. This will give users access to the website building functionality while we complete the enhanced features.

Should I proceed with Phase 1 implementation to get your BUILD feature launch-ready?
