LUXURY DESIGN SPECIFICATION - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

The Bridge system must match SSELFIE's luxury editorial design standards, NOT generic SaaS styling:

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
1. COLOR PALETTE: Only black (#000000), white (#FFFFFF), and gray (#6B7280, #9CA3AF, #F3F4F6)
   - NO emerald, blue, amber, or any bright colors
   - NO colored badges or status indicators
   - Use black text on white backgrounds with subtle gray accents

2. TYPOGRAPHY: Times New Roman consistently throughout
   - Headlines: font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif
   - Body text: font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif  
   - NO mixing with other fonts
   - Elegant hierarchy with generous whitespace

3. LAYOUT PHILOSOPHY: Chanel-level minimalism
   - Generous whitespace - minimum 2rem spacing between elements
   - Single-column elegant layout, NO busy grid systems
   - Focus on essential information only
   - Swiss precision in alignment and spacing

4. PROGRESS DISPLAY STYLE:
   - Minimal text indicator: "Implementation in progress..." in Times New Roman
   - Subtle gray progress bar with black completion indicator
   - NO colored dots, badges, or busy status cards
   - Appears elegantly in bottom-right corner with subtle shadow

5. BRIDGE MONITOR PAGE STYLE:
   - Clean white background with black typography
   - Agent status as simple text list, not cards or grids
   - Task progress as elegant typography, not colored indicators
   - Minimal navigation with generous spacing

EXAMPLES OF WRONG vs RIGHT:
❌ WRONG: Emerald badge saying "ACTIVE" with colored background
✅ RIGHT: Simple black text "Active" in Times New Roman

❌ WRONG: Grid of metric cards with colored icons  
✅ RIGHT: Elegant vertical list with minimal typography

❌ WRONG: Colored progress bars with percentages
✅ RIGHT: Subtle gray progress line with black completion indicator

LUXURY STANDARDS:
- Think Chanel product page, not SaaS dashboard
- Think Swiss watch precision, not startup energy
- Think luxury magazine layout, not technical interface
- Think minimal art gallery, not busy control panel

This is SSELFIE STUDIO - every pixel must reflect luxury, elegance, and sophistication.
