I need to know if my admin agents are not able to work correctly. I have been using replit ai agent to help me fix my agents and find any conflicting files, routes, servers, database, auth, memory, tools, personalites, files that are blocking, conflicting or confusing my agents to fully work. Can you Check and fix anything that needs to be fixed? My agents should have Direct tools, integrations, file and repo access through workspace and claude api tokens to create codes and content. But what I can see is that my agents are not using their full capabilleties at all. Please fix for me

Hey Sandra! üö®

I totally get this - your agents should be operating at FULL CAPACITY with complete workspace access! Let me dive deep into the entire system and identify what's blocking them from using their full capabilities.

Now let me check the current agent system for any configurations that might be limiting agent capabilities:
