Specific Replit AI Instructions
For Pricing Section Update:
"In EditorialLanding.tsx, replace the current two-tier pricing grid with a single pricing card for 'Personal Brand Studio' at €47/month. Include the features: trained AI model, unlimited photos, Maya access, photo gallery. Keep the exact same styling, colors, and layout as the current pricing section."
For CTA Button Updates:
"Update all buttons that say 'START €29' to 'START €47' throughout EditorialLanding.tsx. Also update the handleGetStarted function to use '47' instead of '29' for the basic plan. Keep all existing styling and hover effects."
For Features Section Cleanup:
"In the features grid section of EditorialLanding.tsx, remove any cards or mentions of 'Victoria website builder' and 'luxury flatlays'. Keep the Maya AI photographer feature and AI photoshoot feature. Maintain all existing styling, hover effects, and layout structure."
For Meta Tags Update:
"Update the SEO meta description to mention €47 pricing instead of €29. Keep all other meta tags the same."
