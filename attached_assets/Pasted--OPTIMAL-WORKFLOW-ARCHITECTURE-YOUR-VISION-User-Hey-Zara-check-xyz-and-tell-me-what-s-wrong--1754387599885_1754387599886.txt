ðŸš€ OPTIMAL WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE (YOUR VISION):
User: "Hey Zara, check xyz and tell me what's wrong"
  â†“
1. Zara (Authentic Voice): "I'll investigate that for you..." [STREAM]
  â†“
2. Zara (Internal): Triggers tool execution [NO API COST]
  â†“
3. Tools Execute: search_filesystem, diagnostics, etc [BYPASS SYSTEM]
  â†“
4. Tool Results: Stored in internal buffer for Zara to review
  â†“
5. Zara (Continuation): Reviews findings, generates summary [MINIMAL TOKENS]
  â†“
6. Zara (Authentic Voice): "I found the issue in..." [STREAM CONTINUES]
  â†“
7. If fixes needed: Zara triggers more tools â†’ validation â†’ summary
ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
PHASE 1: Agent-Tool Communication Bus
Location: server/services/agent-tool-orchestrator.ts (NEW)
Agent Trigger System: Agents send tool execution requests internally
Tool Execution Queue: Manages multiple tool operations per agent
Result Buffer: Stores findings for agent review without API calls
Continuation Signals: Notify agents when tools complete
PHASE 2: Streaming Continuity Manager
Location: server/services/streaming-continuation-service.ts (NEW)
Stream Persistence: Keep agent voice stream alive during tool execution
Context Injection: Insert tool results directly into agent context
Response Resumption: Agent continues speaking after tool completion
Multi-Tool Coordination: Handle sequences of tool calls seamlessly
PHASE 3: Enhanced Bypass Integration
Location: server/middleware/intelligent-bypass.js (ENHANCE EXISTING)
Agent-Initiated Bypass: Tools triggered by agents, not Claude API parameters
Context Awareness: Tools understand agent intent without expensive API calls
Result Routing: Direct findings to specific agent contexts
Validation Loops: Agents trigger verification tools automatically
PHASE 4: Claude API Optimization
Location: server/services/claude-api-service-rebuilt.ts (MAJOR REFACTOR)
Content-Only Mode: Claude API used ONLY for agent personality responses
Tool-Free Conversations: Remove tools from Claude API calls entirely
Minimal Context: Strip tool execution history from Claude conversations
Response Focus: Agents generate authentic responses to findings, not manage tools
