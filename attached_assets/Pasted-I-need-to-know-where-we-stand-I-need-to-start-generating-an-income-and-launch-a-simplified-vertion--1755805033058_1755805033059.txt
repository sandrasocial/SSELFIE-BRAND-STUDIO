I understand you're looking to move forward with launching a simplified version of your business model and start generating income. As your strategic partner, I'll help analyze where we stand and create an actionable plan.

First, let me search through the project files to get a comprehensive view of our current state.

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... To help create an effective plan, I need some specific information from you:

What are the core services/features you want to include in this simplified version?
What is your target timeline for launching this simplified version?
Do you have any specific revenue targets or pricing model in mind?
Who is your primary target audience for this initial launch?
Once you provide these details, I can:

Create a phased launch plan
Identify the minimum viable features needed
Set up a timeline with clear milestones
Coordinate with our technical team to prioritize development
Help establish the initial pricing and revenue model
I've already initiated a technical status check with Victoria to understand our current capabilities. This will help us identify what we can launch quickly versus what needs more development time.

Would you please share those details so I can craft a targeted launch strategy that aligns with your immediate income generation goals? I'm particularly interested in knowing what you consider the most essential features that could be launched quickly to start generating revenue.
