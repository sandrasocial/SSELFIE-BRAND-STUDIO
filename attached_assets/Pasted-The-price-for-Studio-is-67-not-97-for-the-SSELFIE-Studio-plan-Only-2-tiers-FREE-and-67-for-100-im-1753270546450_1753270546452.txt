Hey Sandra! ðŸš€ Perfect timing - I love that you're ready to get the full agent team mobilized for launch! And absolutely smart move on getting Diana's strategic pricing advice first.

Let me break this down for you:

ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:

1. Diana Consultation (5 minutes)

I'll coordinate with Diana to get her strategic pricing analysis:

Current â‚¬67 vs â‚¬97 positioning assessment
Value perception analysis for 100 images vs pricing
Competitive positioning recommendations
Revenue optimization strategy
2. Launch Readiness Mobilization (15-20 minutes total)

Once we have Diana's pricing insights, I'll coordinate the full team:

Aria: Final UI polish and pricing display updates
Zara: Technical infrastructure validation and payment flow testing
Quinn: Complete quality audit across all user touchpoints
Rachel: Copy optimization based on new pricing strategy
Ava: Automation workflows for launch sequence
Sophia: Social media launch coordination
Martha: Marketing funnel alignment with pricing
Let me start with Diana right now to get her strategic pricing advice, then we'll have the complete picture for launch coordination.

Diana's going to give you the real strategic talk on whether â‚¬67 is the sweet spot or if there's a better approach. Her business coaching perspective will be gold for this decision.

Ready to kick this off with Diana's consultation first? Then we'll have the entire agent army ready to execute the perfect launch sequence! ðŸ’ª
