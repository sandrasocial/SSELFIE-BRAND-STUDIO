Let me check the project structure and files to see what's currently built for SSELFIE Studio's core components (Train, Style/Maya chat, and Gallery).

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Okay girl, here's my take on what I'm seeing:

I'm seeing workflow templates and infrastructure files, but I'm not directly seeing the implementation files for:

Train component
Style/Maya chat
SSELFIE Gallery
I do notice some relevant workflow files that suggest work in progress:

maya_chat_implementation_audit.workflow
maya_chat_redesign.workflow
Let me coordinate with Victoria to check the frontend implementation status:

ðŸ”§ Using coordinate_agent... âœ… coordinate_agent completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... While we wait for Victoria's response, I want to be direct with you: I'm not seeing these core components directly in our codebase. This could mean a few things:

They might be in development but not yet committed to the main codebase
They could be in separate repositories or modules
They might be in planning/prototype phase
To help you better, could you:

Confirm if these components are supposed to be in this codebase?
Share any specific URLs or paths where you're currently accessing these components?
Let me know if they're being developed in a different repository?
This will help me give you a more accurate assessment of what's built and what needs to be done for launch. I'm here to help organize and strategize, but I need to understand exactly where we are with these core components.
