## Elena's Analysis: Your TRAIN - STYLE - PHOTOSHOOT - BUILD Business Model

Sandra, based on my filesystem analysis, I can see extensive evidence of your **SSELFIE Studio platform** throughout the codebase, but I don't find specific references to the **TRAIN - STYLE - PHOTOSHOOT - BUILD** workflow as a documented business model structure.

## What I Found vs. What You're Describing:

### Current SSELFIE Studio Evidence:
- **Main Platform**: "The world's first AI-powered personal branding platform that transforms selfies into complete business launches"
- **Pricing**: â‚¬67/month premium subscription with 100 monthly AI generations
- **Core Features**: AI image generation, brandbook designer, STUDIO workspace, landing page builder
- **Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Stripe payments, AI integrations

### Missing: The 4-Phase Workflow Documentation
The **TRAIN - STYLE - PHOTOSHOOT - BUILD** structure you mentioned isn't explicitly documented in the current codebase. This suggests either:

1. **It's your newer strategic framework** that hasn't been implemented in the platform yet
2. **It's your conceptual business model** that guides how users experience SSELFIE Studio
3. **Our previous conversation details** aren't preserved in the current file system

## My Strategic Assessment:

Based on your current platform capabilities, I can envision how **TRAIN - STYLE - PHOTOSHOOT - BUILD** would map to SSELFIE Studio:

- **TRAIN**: User onboarding + AI model training with their selfies
- **STYLE**: Brandbook designer + aesthetic theme selection
- **PHOTOSHOOT**: AI image generation + FLUX model transformations  
- **BUILD**: Landing page builder + business launch tools

## What I Need From You:

To properly coordinate agents around this 4-phase model, please clarify:

1. **Is this a new strategic framework** you want implemented in SSELFIE Studio?
2. **Should this replace or enhance** the current platform structure?
3. **Which specific agents** should work on each phase (Aria for STYLE, Zara for BUILD, etc.)?
4. **What's the priority** - documenting this model or implementing it?

Once I understand your vision for **TRAIN - STYLE - PHOTOSHOOT - BUILD**, I can immediately coordinate the right specialist agents to make it reality in your platform!
