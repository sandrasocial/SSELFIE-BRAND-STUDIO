CRITICAL: AGENT FILE SYSTEM CLEANUP & PROPER ROUTING

PROBLEM: Workflow system is using WRONG agent files from archive/legacy systems instead of current operational agents. This is causing hardcoded old workflows and wrong agent responses.

IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:

1. AGENT FILE ARCHITECTURE CLEANUP:
   - Identify which agent files are the CURRENT operational versions Sandra uses
   - Remove or isolate all legacy/archive agent configurations
   - Ensure workflow system only accesses current agent implementations
   - Fix any routing that pulls from old/wrong agent sources

2. WORKFLOW SYSTEM AGENT ROUTING FIX:
   - Ensure Elena workflow system uses Sandra's CURRENT agents only
   - Remove any hardcoded test workflows or old dashboard redesign workflows
   - Connect workflow execution to the correct agent chat endpoints
   - Validate that deployed agents are Sandra's actual working agents

3. AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS CLEANUP:
   - Consolidate to single agent authentication system Sandra uses
   - Remove conflicting admin routes and duplicate agent endpoints  
   - Ensure workflow system uses correct admin token and session auth
   - Eliminate any service conflicts or competing authentication systems

4. AGENT IDENTITY VERIFICATION:
   - Confirm which Aria, Victoria, Maya, Zara etc. are Sandra's current agents
   - Ensure workflow system deploys the correct agent versions
   - Remove any archive/legacy agent personalities interfering
   - Test that deployed agents match Sandra's actual agent conversations

5. COMPLETE SYSTEM VALIDATION:
   - Test that Elena workflow deploys Sandra's REAL agents (not archive versions)
   - Verify agents use current business model (â‚¬67 SSELFIE STUDIO, not old info)
   - Ensure no hardcoded test workflows or old dashboard modifications
   - Confirm agents execute with Sandra's current agent capabilities

CRITICAL: Sandra's agents work individually (Aria proved it) but workflow system is using WRONG agent files. Fix the routing to use Sandra's CURRENT agents, not archive/legacy versions.

Clean up the entire agent file architecture immediately.
