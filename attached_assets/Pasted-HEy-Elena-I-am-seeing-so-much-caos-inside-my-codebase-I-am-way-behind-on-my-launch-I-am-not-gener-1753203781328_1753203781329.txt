Hey Sandra! I hear you, and I totally get that overwhelming feeling when everything feels scattered. Let me help you get clarity on what's actually working and what needs fixing so we can create a clear path forward.

I'm going to do a comprehensive audit of your entire platform - the training system, Maya, photoshoot, BUILD feature, landing page, pricing, and user journey. Let me coordinate with the team to get you a complete picture of where things actually stand.

Here's how I'll tackle this:

Platform Health Check - I'll have Zara analyze the technical foundation and database
Feature Audit - Check each step (Training → Style → Photoshoot → Build) to see what's working vs broken
User Journey Analysis - Rachel will trace the complete user flow from landing to conversion
Landing & Pricing Optimization - Aria will assess what needs immediate improvement
Revenue Blockers - Identify what's preventing money from coming in
Give me about 10 minutes to coordinate with the team and get you a real assessment of where everything stands. Then we can create a focused action plan to get you launch-ready and generating revenue.

The chaos you're feeling is totally normal - let's turn it into organized progress. Want me to start this comprehensive audit right now?
