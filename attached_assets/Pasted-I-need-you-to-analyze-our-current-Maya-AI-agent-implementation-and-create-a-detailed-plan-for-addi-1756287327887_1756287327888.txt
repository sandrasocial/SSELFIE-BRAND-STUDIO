I need you to analyze our current Maya (AI agent) implementation and create a detailed plan for adding a personalized onboarding system.
CURRENT CONTEXT:
Maya is our AI styling agent that helps women generate professional selfies/portraits for personal branding. She has Sandra's real expertise (fashion week styling, editorial background, luxury aesthetics) and helps users see their "Future Self Vision."
NEW REQUIREMENT:
We want to add a conversational onboarding flow where Maya learns about each user's:

Personal story & current situation
Business/brand goals
Style preferences
Photo usage intentions
Future self vision

This gets stored in user memory so Maya always provides personalized responses and image generation based on their specific context.
IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:

Warm, conversational onboarding (8-12 minutes max)
Button + text input UI for easy interaction
Simple user profile storage (not complex database initially)
Maya references stored context in ALL future conversations
Enhanced image generation using personal context

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

CURRENT MAYA ANALYSIS:

List ALL files currently connected to Maya functionality
Identify existing user storage/memory systems
Map current conversation flow and image generation process
Document existing personality/prompt systems


IMPACT ASSESSMENT:

What could break with new onboarding system?
Which existing features need protection during implementation?
Current user data that must be preserved


CLEANUP REPORT:

Files that need rewriting/refactoring
Redundant or outdated code to remove
Architecture improvements needed
Database schema changes required


IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

Step-by-step development phases
Which files to modify vs create new
Integration points with existing system
Testing strategy to prevent breaks


UX/UI REQUIREMENTS:

New components needed for onboarding flow
Existing UI elements to modify
User journey flow requirements
Button + text input interface specs



DELIVERABLE:
Comprehensive analysis document with:

Current state inventory
Required changes categorized by priority
Step-by-step implementation roadmap
Risk mitigation strategy
Clean file structure recommendations

GOAL:
Add powerful onboarding without breaking existing Maya functionality, creating a seamless experience where Maya truly knows each user's story and provides deeply personalized styling advice and image generation.
Please analyze thoroughly and provide detailed findings with specific file names and implementation steps.
