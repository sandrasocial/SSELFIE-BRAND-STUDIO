TASK: Locate Maya's Intelligent Generation System
OBJECTIVE: Find existing code for Maya's dynamic prompting and parameter adjustment

SEARCH FOR MAYA'S INTELLIGENCE:

1. DYNAMIC PROMPTING SYSTEM
   Search all Maya files for:
   - Prompt enhancement/modification logic
   - Close-up vs half-body vs full-scene detection
   - Style-based prompt adjustments
   - Maya's prompt engineering intelligence

2. PARAMETER INTELLIGENCE
   Look for code that adjusts:
   - Image count based on shot type (close-up = 2, half-body = 3, full-scene = 4)
   - Guidance scale adjustments per style
   - Step count optimization
   - Seed handling logic
   - Preset-specific parameter sets

3. MAYA'S GENERATION INTELLIGENCE FILES
   Search specifically in:
   - server/agents/personalities/maya-personality.ts
   - server/services/ (any Maya-related services)
   - server/routes/maya-unified.ts (look for commented/unused logic)
   - Any files with "generation", "prompt", or "parameter" in the name

4. LOOK FOR EXISTING PROMPT ENHANCEMENT
   Find references to:
   - "close up", "half body", "full scene"
   - Style categories: Editorial, Business, Lifestyle, Luxury
   - Prompt enhancement functions
   - Parameter calculation logic
   - Maya's styling expertise application

5. CHECK FOR DISABLED/COMMENTED CODE
   Look for:
   - Commented-out generation logic
   - TODO comments about prompting
   - Disabled intelligent parameter selection
   - References to shot type detection

6. ANALYZE MAYA'S PERSONALITY FOR GENERATION LOGIC
   In maya-personality.ts, look for:
   - Generation-specific prompting rules
   - Style expertise application
   - Parameter selection intelligence
   - Professional photography knowledge

SPECIFIC SEARCH TARGETS:
- Functions named: enhancePrompt, adjustParameters, selectPreset
- Variables: shotType, imageCount, guidanceScale, steps
- Comments containing: "close up", "parameters", "intelligent"
- Code that processes Maya's styling decisions

DELIVERABLES:
1. Location of existing intelligent prompting system
2. Current parameter adjustment logic (if any)
3. Maya's shot type detection system
4. Why the intelligence isn't being used in generation
5. Complete code snippets of found intelligence
6. Integration points where intelligence should connect to Replicate API

CONSTRAINTS:
- Search ALL Maya-related files thoroughly
- Include exact file paths and line numbers
- Copy complete functions/logic blocks found
- Identify if code is active, commented, or disconnected

EXPECTED FINDINGS:
Maya's sophisticated generation intelligence that needs reconnection to the Replicate API calls.
