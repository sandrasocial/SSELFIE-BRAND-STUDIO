PHASE 3: Performance Optimization and Cleanup
PHASE 3: Performance Optimization and Code Cleanup
OBJECTIVE: Optimize system performance and remove technical debt
PRIORITY: Medium - Improves user experience and maintainability

SPECIFIC TASKS:

1. QUERY OPTIMIZATION AND CACHING:
   a) Frontend Query Optimization:
      - Review TanStack Query configurations in Maya, Gallery, and Workspace
      - Set appropriate staleTime for user data (5 minutes minimum)
      - Implement proper query keys to prevent unnecessary refetches
      - Add loading states where missing

   b) Database Query Optimization:
      - Review slow queries in gallery image loading
      - Optimize Maya chat history queries with proper indexing
      - Ensure user model queries are efficient
      - Add query result caching where appropriate

   c) API Response Optimization:
      - Minimize payload sizes for large image lists
      - Implement pagination for gallery with 20 items per page
      - Compress API responses where possible
      - Add proper HTTP caching headers

2. BUNDLE SIZE OPTIMIZATION:
   a) Remove Unused Imports:
      - Scan all pages for unused React imports
      - Remove unused utility functions and components
      - Clean up legacy component imports
      - Remove unused CSS classes and styles

   b) Code Splitting Implementation:
      - Lazy load Gallery page (not critical for initial load)
      - Lazy load Training page (only needed after payment)
      - Keep Maya and Workspace eagerly loaded (core features)
      - Implement proper loading states for lazy components

   c) Asset Optimization:
      - Optimize image assets used in UI
      - Minimize CSS bundle size
      - Remove duplicate CSS rules
      - Compress fonts and static assets

3. MEMORY LEAK PREVENTION:
   a) Maya Chat Cleanup:
      - Ensure WebSocket connections are properly closed
      - Clean up polling intervals when components unmount
      - Remove event listeners on component cleanup
      - Clear large image arrays when not needed

   b) Training Process Cleanup:
      - Stop status polling when user navigates away
      - Clean up file upload progress tracking
      - Clear temporary image previews from memory
      - Ensure training monitors don't run indefinitely

   c) Gallery Cleanup:
      - Implement virtual scrolling for large image collections
      - Unload non-visible images from memory
      - Clean up image selection state
      - Prevent memory accumulation in favorites

4. COMPONENT CLEANUP AND STANDARDIZATION:
   a) Remove Unused Components:
      - Identify and remove legacy components
      - Clean up archived admin components from member pages
      - Remove duplicate utility components
      - Consolidate similar functionality

   b) Standardize Naming Conventions:
      - Ensure component files use PascalCase
      - Ensure utility files use kebab-case
      - Standardize prop naming across components
      - Fix inconsistent variable naming

   c) TypeScript Improvements:
      - Add proper types for API responses
      - Fix any 'any' types with proper interfaces
      - Add type safety for image URL handling
      - Improve error type definitions

5. DATABASE CLEANUP:
   a) Complete aiImages Migration:
      - Verify all data migrated to generatedImages
      - Update remaining queries to use new schema
      - Plan deprecation of legacy aiImages table
      - Ensure no functionality relies on old schema

   b) Index Optimization:
      - Add missing indexes for frequent queries
      - Review slow query performance
      - Optimize user-based filtering indexes
      - Add composite indexes where needed

   c) Data Cleanup:
      - Remove orphaned records if any exist
      - Clean up test data from development
      - Optimize storage of large text fields
      - Implement data retention policies

PERFORMANCE TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Measure page load times before and after optimizations
- Test gallery loading with 100+ images
- Verify Maya chat responsiveness with long conversations
- Check training page performance with multiple uploads
- Monitor memory usage during extended sessions

CLEANUP VALIDATION:
- Ensure all removed code doesn't break functionality
- Verify all imports resolve correctly
- Test that component refactoring doesn't change behavior
- Confirm database changes don't affect existing queries

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not modify core business logic
- Do not change user-facing functionality
- Do not alter payment processing
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Preserve all user data and settings

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Faster page load times across all routes
- Reduced memory usage during extended sessions  
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- Optimized database performance
- Reduced bundle size and improved Core Web Vitals
- No functional changes or user-facing differences

Complete Phase 3 fully and measure performance improvements before requesting Phase 4.
