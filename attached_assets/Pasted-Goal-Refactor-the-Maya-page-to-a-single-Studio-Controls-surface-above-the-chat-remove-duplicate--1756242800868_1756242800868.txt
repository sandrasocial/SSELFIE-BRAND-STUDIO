Goal: Refactor the Maya page to a single “Studio Controls” surface above the chat; remove duplicate selectors inside the chat. Keep hero and copy unchanged. Do not touch auth, routing, or backend endpoints.

Constraints

Keep existing sendMessage, generateImages, and polling as-is.

Do not modify the hero section, MemberNavigation, or auth hooks.

Do not alter server prompt logic (where the mandatory tokens are injected).

Preserve /api/member-maya-chat and /api/maya-generate-images behaviors.

Tasks

Remove duplication

Delete the “style quick-select” grid that appears inside the welcome/first message area.

Remove the small preset/seed controls from the header or hide them behind a collapsed Advanced <details> (default closed).

Add Studio Controls (inside .chat-header, under the subtitle)

Scene cards (radio, single select): close-up, half-body, full-scene.

Use gray placeholders (#f5f5f5) for images with labels. Provide constants to swap image URLs later.

Cards use your editorial card look (border 1px #e5e5e5, hover: border #0a0a0a, subtle scale).

After a scene is selected, reveal:

Category chips (single select): Future CEO, Off-Duty Model, Social Queen, Date Night, Everyday Icon, Power Player.

Mood chips (multi select, max 2): Quiet Luxury, Cinematic, Natural Light, Studio Clean.

Chips are pill buttons (uppercase, letter-spaced, 11px) with selected state (black bg / white text).

Show a compact selection summary + Compose with Maya button (small, black).

Add a Reset link that clears selections.

State

const [scene, setScene] = useState<'close-up'|'half-body'|'full-scene'|null>(null);
const [category, setCategory] = useState<string|null>(null);
const [moods, setMoods] = useState<string[]>([]); // cap at 2


When scene changes, keep category/moods.

Mood toggles should enforce a max of 2 (drop the oldest if a 3rd is chosen).

Compose action

On Compose with Maya, build a brief and send through the existing pipeline:

const brief = [
  scene ? scene.replace('-', ' ') : '',
  category || '',
  moods.length ? moods.join(', ') : ''
].filter(Boolean).join(' • ');

// Feed Maya something natural, not technical:
setInput(`Maya, create a ${scene ?? ''} ${category ?? ''} look with ${moods.join(' and ') || 'your signature touch'}. Style outfit, light, camera and background to feel elevated and editorial.`);
await sendMessage(); // reuse existing function


Do not include technical tokens in the UI brief; backend already adds mandatory “raw photo, visible skin pores…” etc.

Chat area

Keep messages and “Create Photos” button exactly as they are now.

Do not render any picker UI inside messages.

Styling

Follow Sandra’s style guide (Times for big headings, system sans for UI, #0a0a0a / #ffffff / #f5f5f5 / #e5e5e5 / #666).

Spacing: generous; chips are small but airy; cards use soft hover and subtle scale.

Mobile: stack cards (1 per row), chips in wrapped rows, sticky input at bottom.

Safety / QA

No changes to auth or fetch utilities.

Ensure all fetches keep credentials: 'include'.

Don’t rename existing API routes.

Leave hero untouched.
