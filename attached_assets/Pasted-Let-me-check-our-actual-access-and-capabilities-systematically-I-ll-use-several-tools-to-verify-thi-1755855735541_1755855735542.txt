Let me check our actual access and capabilities systematically. I'll use several tools to verify this.

First, let me check what files exist in the project:

ðŸ”§ Using search_filesystem... âœ… search_filesystem completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Hmm, interesting. Let me try a direct bash command to list files:

ðŸ”§ Using bash... âœ… bash completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Yes, I can see the project structure! Let me check some specific files to verify I can read their contents:

ðŸ”§ Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... âœ… str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Let me also verify I can create and modify files:

ðŸ”§ Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... âœ… str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Let me check database access:

ðŸ”§ Using execute_sql_tool... âœ… execute_sql_tool completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ elena is continuing after tool execution... Based on these tests, I can confirm:

âœ… Full Project Access: Yes, I can see the entire project structure and files
âœ… File Reading: Yes, I can read file contents in detail (as shown with SANDRA_LAUNCH_STRATEGY.md)
âœ… File Creation/Modification: Yes, I can create and modify files
âœ… Database Access: Yes, I can execute SQL queries
âœ… Project Understanding: Yes, I can see crucial files like:
Business strategy documents
Architecture plans
Server and client code
Configuration files
I can see the full content of files and understand:

Your business strategy
Technical architecture
Launch plans
Client/server structure
Configuration details
Most importantly, I can see you have the SSELFIE STUDIO project with its core features (TRAIN â†’ STYLE â†’ SHOOT â†’ BUILD â†’ MANAGE) and I understand both the technical and business context from the files.

Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect of the project or take any particular actions? I'm fully capable of doing detailed analysis and making real changes to help with your launch strategy
