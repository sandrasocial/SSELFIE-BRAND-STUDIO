SSELFIE Studio - Launch Ready README
Mission Statement
Get a professional personal brand photoshoot every month - no photographer, no awkward poses, just you looking amazing in every image.
Core Value Proposition
Replace expensive photoshoots ($500-2000+) with your personal AI photographer that knows your best angles and generates unlimited professional brand photos on demand.

Simplified Business Model (v1 Launch)
TRAIN → STYLE → GALLERY
TRAIN: Users upload 10-20 selfies to create their personal AI model
STYLE: Chat with Maya (AI stylist) to generate perfect brand photoshoots
GALLERY: Save favorite images by hearting them for brand asset library
Removed for v1: SHOOT page (redundant - Maya handles everything), BUILD feature (add later as premium tier)

Target Audience
Women entrepreneurs and creators who:
Want professional brand photos but hate traditional photoshoots
Need consistent, high-quality images for social media
Are building personal brands but struggle with visual content
Want to look polished without the hassle and expense

Pricing Strategy
Single Tier: Personal Brand Studio
Price: $47/month Rationale:
Cost coverage: Training ($2-3) + 50-100 images ($10-20) + margin
Positioned as professional service, not cheap app filter
Less than one traditional photoshoot session
Premium enough to attract serious users
Cost Analysis
Training: $2-3 per user (one-time)
Image Generation: $0.20 per image
Monthly user cost: ~$15-25 (month 1), $5-10 (ongoing)
Profit margin: 3-4x cost ratio

Core Messages
"Never pay for another photoshoot"
"Your personal AI photographer who knows your best angles"
"Professional brand photos on demand"

Sandra's Story Integration
The Evolution: "I went from teaching women how to take better selfies to building AI that takes perfect selfies FOR them"
Authentic founder story: Single mom, ex-hairdresser, 0-120K journey through selfie content
The Breakthrough: "I realized teaching technique wasn't enough - women needed the actual photos, not just tips"
Behind-the-scenes: "No perfect highlight reel - just what actually works, now automated"
