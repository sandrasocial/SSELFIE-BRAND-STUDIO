Ok zara, Can you take a look at my project. We need to start launching soon. Where do we begin?

I'll help you analyze the project systematically to assess its launch readiness. Let me start by gathering some key information about the current state.

First, let's look at the project structure and key files:
ðŸ”§ Using search_filesystem... âœ… search_filesystem completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... 2. Let's check for any existing database structure:

ðŸ”§ Using execute_sql_tool... âœ… execute_sql_tool completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... 3. Let's check for any current code issues or errors:

ðŸ”§ Using get_latest_lsp_diagnostics... âœ… get_latest_lsp_diagnostics completed

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ zara is continuing after tool execution... I can see this is a fairly complex project with both client and server components. There are some key areas we need to address before launch:

Critical TypeScript Errors:
Multiple component typing issues in the client code
Missing module dependencies
API and database integration issues
Configuration errors
Database Setup:
The database appears to be empty or not properly configured yet
Project Structure: We have a full-stack application with:
Client-side React/TypeScript components
Server-side Node.js backend
Database integration layer
To begin launching, we need to tackle these in order. Let me help create an action plan:

First Priority - Fix Critical Dependencies:
Install missing packages (react-hook-form, styled-components, etc.)
Update TypeScript configurations
Resolve module import issues
Second Priority - Database Setup:
Configure database connection
Set up required tables
Initialize basic data structure
Third Priority - Component Fixes:
Address TypeScript errors in components
Verify API integrations
Test core functionality
Would you like me to:

Start fixing the dependency issues first?
Help set up the database structure?
Begin addressing the TypeScript errors?
Look at a specific area you're most concerned about?
Please let me know which area you'd like to tackle first, and I'll help guide you through the launch preparation process step by step.
