## Basic model info

Model name: ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer
Model description: Fine-tune FLUX.1-dev using ai-toolkit


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Prompt for generated image. If you include the `trigger_word` used in the training process you are more likely to activate the trained object, style, or concept in the resulting image. (string)
- image (optional): Input image for img2img or inpainting mode. If provided, aspect_ratio, width, and height inputs are ignored. (string)
- mask (optional): Input mask for inpainting mode. Black areas will be preserved, white areas will be inpainted. Must be provided along with 'image' for inpainting mode. (string)
- aspect_ratio (optional): Aspect ratio for the generated image in text-to-image mode. The size will always be 1 megapixel, i.e. 1024x1024 if aspect ratio is 1:1. To use arbitrary width and height, set aspect ratio to 'custom'. Note: Ignored in img2img and inpainting modes. (string)
- width (optional): Width of the generated image in text-to-image mode. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 16 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16). Note: Ignored in img2img and inpainting modes. (integer)
- height (optional): Height of the generated image in text-to-image mode. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 16 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16). Note: Ignored in img2img and inpainting modes. (integer)
- num_outputs (optional): Number of images to output. (integer)
- lora_scale (optional): Determines how strongly the main LoRA should be applied. Sane results between 0 and 1. (number)
- num_inference_steps (optional): Number of inference steps. More steps can give more detailed images, but take longer. (integer)
- model (optional): Which model to run inferences with. The dev model needs around 28 steps but the schnell model only needs around 4 steps. (string)
- guidance_scale (optional): Guidance scale for the diffusion process. Lower values can give more realistic images. Good values to try are 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5 (number)
- prompt_strength (optional): Prompt strength when using img2img / inpaint. 1.0 corresponds to full destruction of information in image (number)
- seed (optional): Random seed. Set for reproducible generation. (integer)
- extra_lora (optional): Combine this fine-tune with another LoRA. Supports Replicate models in the format <owner>/<username> or <owner>/<username>/<version>, HuggingFace URLs in the format huggingface.co/<owner>/<model-name>, CivitAI URLs in the format civitai.com/models/<id>[/<model-name>], or arbitrary .safetensors URLs from the Internet. For example, 'fofr/flux-pixar-cars' (string)
- extra_lora_scale (optional): Determines how strongly the extra LoRA should be applied. (number)
- output_format (optional): Format of the output images. (string)
- output_quality (optional): Quality when saving the output images, from 0 to 100. 100 is best quality, 0 is lowest quality. Not relevant for .png outputs (integer)
- disable_safety_checker (optional): Disable safety checker for generated images. (boolean)


## Model output schema

{
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri"
  },
  "title": "Output"
}

If the input or output schema includes a format of URI, it is referring to a file.
