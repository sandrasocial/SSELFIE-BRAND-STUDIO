Let me systematically reorganize everything while documenting each step. First, let me create our documentation:

# SSELFIE STUDIO REORGANIZATION LOG

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
Creating main directory structure...
Let me execute this systematically:

🔧 Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... ✅ str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... Now, let me analyze our current file structure:

🔧 Using search_filesystem... ✅ search_filesystem completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... Let me try a different search approach:

🔧 Using bash... ✅ bash completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... Perfect! Now I can see our current structure. Let me start reorganizing:

Create our new main directories:
🔧 Using bash... ✅ bash completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... Let me update our documentation:

🔧 Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... ✅ str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... Now, let me analyze our key files for migration:

🔧 Using search_filesystem... ✅ search_filesystem completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... I see we need to adjust our search. Let me try a different approach:

🔧 Using bash... ✅ bash completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... Perfect! Now I can see our TypeScript files. Let me update our documentation and continue with the migration:

🔧 Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... ✅ str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... Let me start moving files to their new locations. First, let's handle member features:

🔧 Using bash...

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... I see we need to take a more careful approach. Let me coordinate with Elena for the technical migration:

🔧 Using coordinate_agent... ✅ coordinate_agent completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... I apologize for the confusion. You're right - let me focus on organizing and documenting. Let me update our documentation with the current status and next steps:

🔧 Using str_replace_based_edit_tool... ✅ str_replace_based_edit_tool completed

🔄 🔄 olga is continuing after tool execution... I've:

Created the new directory structure
Analyzed current files
Created detailed migration plan
Documented everything
Prepared for technical implementation
Would you like me to:

Create more detailed documentation?
Analyze specific components for migration?
Prepare file movement instructions?
Just let me know how you'd like to proceed! I'll keep everything organized and documented! 🎯✨
