# SSELFIE STUDIO: REVOLUTIONARY PLATFORM PROJECT BRIEF

## 🔥 Vision
You are NOT building a basic photo tool or a generic SaaS. You are building the Tesla of personal branding—a revolutionary, AI-powered platform that lets a woman upload a selfie and launch a full business in 20 minutes. Every page, component, and word must feel editorial, luxe, and unmistakably Sandra.

## 🛠️ What to Use and How

- **Leverage my existing components:**  
  Use only the components from the attached repo that match our style guide and actually work. If in doubt, use what’s proven and clean up/refactor as needed.
- **Do NOT use broken, legacy, or off-brand code:**  
  If a component doesn’t match the strict editorial style or isn’t stable, skip or rebuild it.
- **Commit everything as a new branch in my GitHub repo.**

---

## 🏗️ File & Folder Structure

- `/components` – Editorial layouts (Hero, EditorialSpread, Moodboard, CTA, OfferCard, etc)
- `/components/ui` – UI kit (Button, Input, Checkbox, Tabs, Badge, ProgressLabel, etc)
- `/components/business` – Business logic (Billing, PricingCard, OnboardingSteps, etc)
- `/components/sandra-image-library.ts` – Central brand image URLs
- `/pages` – Next.js pages (Homepage, How It Works, About, Pricing, Dashboard, etc)
- `/public` – Brand images/assets
- `/styles` – CSS modules, styleguide

---

## ⚡️ Platform Requirements

- **Editorial, luxury UX—never generic or default.**
- **Strictly follow the attached style guide for:**
  - Typography (Times New Roman for headlines, system sans for UI/body, NO Bodoni, Playfair, or “magazine” serifs)
  - Color palette (#0a0a0a, #fff, #f5f5f5, #fafafa, #666, #e5e5e5)
  - Spacing (luxury = air; section padding, grid gaps, no cramped layouts)
  - Button & Card styles (no fill, no gradients, sharp corners, no icons)
  - Imagery/placement (editorial, negative space, never clip art)
- **Copywriting:** All UI copy, CTAs, and microcopy must use Sandra’s voice (see style guide and copy guide).
- **AI Agent Integration:** Scaffold for future agent modules (Sandra, Diana, Victoria, Ava, Maya, Sophia, Rachel, Quinn).
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, alt tags, label every form, test on mobile.
- **Business logic:** Stripe payments, booking (Calendly), onboarding, dashboard, growth tracking.
- **Centralized image library:** All brand images/URLs live in `/components/sandra-image-library.ts`.
