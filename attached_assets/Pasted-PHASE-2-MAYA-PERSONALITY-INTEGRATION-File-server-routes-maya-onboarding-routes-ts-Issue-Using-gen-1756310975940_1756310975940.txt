## **SIMPLIFIED APPROACH - SINGLE MAYA PERSONALITY**

### **CRITICAL SIMPLIFICATION CHANGES:**

**1. USE ONE MAYA PERSONALITY FILE**
Instead of separate onboarding and generation personalities, both systems should import from:
```typescript
import { MAYA_PERSONALITY } from '../agents/personalities/maya-personality';
2. SIMPLIFIED CATEGORY NAMES (5 INSTEAD OF 6)
Replace all complex category names with these clear, everyday terms:

Professional Headshots (LinkedIn, business credibility)
Social Media Photos (Instagram, TikTok, daily content)
Website Photos (Homepage, about pages, brand storytelling)
Email & Marketing Photos (Newsletters, personal connection)
Premium Brand Photos (High-end collaborations, partnerships)

Removed: "Speaking Power Debut" - not everyone wants to be a speaker.
3. CLEAR VALUE COMMUNICATION
Each category now clearly states:

What specific photos they get
Where they'll use them
What business problem it solves

4. EVERYDAY LANGUAGE
Instead of: "Your Authority Transformation"
Now: "Professional Headshots for LinkedIn and business credibility"
This approach is:

More direct and actionable
Uses language people actually use
Clearly communicates value
Applies to all personal brand builders, not just speakers
"transformationConnection": "Connect their response to Sandra's complete transformation story and professional styling background"
}

Remember: This is luxury personal brand discovery with REAL professional styling expertise, not a survey. Make every exchange feel like a high-end styling consultation with Sandra's AI bestie who has all her professional secrets.
