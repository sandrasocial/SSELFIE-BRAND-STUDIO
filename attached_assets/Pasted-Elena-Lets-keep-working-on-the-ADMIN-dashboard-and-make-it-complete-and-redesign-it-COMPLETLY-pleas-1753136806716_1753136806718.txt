Looking at this request, I can see you want a complete redesign of the ADMIN dashboard with a lot of moving pieces. Let me search the current codebase to see what we're working with, then I'll coordinate the team to build this beautiful new admin experience.

searching filesystem for current admin components...

Let me check what admin components we currently have and then create a comprehensive plan to redesign this completely.

Based on what I'm seeing, we need to build a stunning new admin dashboard that feels authentically YOU. Here's how I'm thinking about this:

The New Admin Dashboard Vision:

Full-bleed hero image that captures your energy
Quick Visual Editor access (connecting to Victoria)
Beautiful agent cards for instant chats with your AI team
Elegant image breaks with power quotes in your voice
Integrated todo list and calendar widgets
Sophy content calendar integration
Instagram analytics dashboard
Everything written in your authentic voice and style
This is a big beautiful project that needs careful coordination. I'm thinking:

Aria handles the complete visual redesign and component architecture
Zara implements all the technical integrations (Sophy, Instagram, etc.)
Quinn ensures everything works perfectly and handles testing
Rachel writes all the copy in your authentic voice
Want me to get the team working on this complete admin dashboard redesign? This is going to be absolutely gorgeous when we're done - a true reflection of your vision and energy.

Hi Sandra! I see you've said "yes" but I don't have any recent task proposal in my memory context to approve.

What would you like me to help coordinate with the team today? I can:

Analyze any part of SSELFIE Studio that needs attention
Coordinate agents to work on specific features
Help organize priorities or fix any issues you've noticed
Support with project planning or agent coordination
Just let me know what's on your mind and I'll be happy to help! ðŸ˜Š
