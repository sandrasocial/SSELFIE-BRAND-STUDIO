Luxury UX Concept: "Personal Brand Photoshoot" Replace the current style list with a visual consultation flow: Step 1: Brand Assessment Maya asks: "Tell me about your personal brand goals" with elegant visual prompts: (these are just examples below. Rewrite them to match simple every day language, Personal brand, Story driven, Instagram, Pinterest fashion, Profile Photos and so on) * "I want to look authoritative and professional" * "I'm building my personal brand" * "I need a new instagram profile images" Each option shows a small preview using Sandras Admin images in that style. (Use gray Placeholders for now so Admin user can manually generate images from her model in the same prompt to use as visual images preview users can click on to generate to get started Step 2: Visual Style Exploration Instead of text labels, show large preview grids: * 3x3 grid of your photos demonstrating each aesthetic * Users click the visual style they want to emulate * Each preview is clearly labeled with the outcome: "Personal branding," "Creative Entrepreneur," "Luxury Lifestyle" (Please create some label outcomes in Mayas style) Step 3: Refinement Chat Maya then asks clarifying questions based on their choice: * "More editorial or commercial feeling?" * "Indoor studio or natural outdoor lighting?" * "Classic or contemporary approach?" Luxury Design Elements: Visual Hierarchy: * Large, high-quality preview images (Sandras admin user generated photos as examples) Use gray placeholders for now. * Minimal text, maximum visual communication * Clean typography with plenty of whitespace Process Transparency: * "Maya is analyzing your photos..." with elegant loading states * "Creating your professional brand images..." with estimated time * Preview generation counter: "Image 1 of 4 complete" Personal Brand Context: * Frame each choice around personal brand outcomes: "Perfect for Instagram," "Ideal for speaking engagements," "Great for website headers" * Show how each style serves different personal branding needs The key is making users feel they're receiving bespoke creative direction, not just filtering through generic options. Sandras previews demonstrate the quality and personalization they'll receive, justifying the premium pricing through the Brand photoshoot experience itself.
