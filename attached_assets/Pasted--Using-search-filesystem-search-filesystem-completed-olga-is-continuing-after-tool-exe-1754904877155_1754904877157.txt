ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ olga is continuing after tool execution... Oh honey, I can see we've got quite a few issues here! Let me analyze what I'm seeing:

Architecture Overview:
We have a React/TypeScript frontend with Radix UI components
Node.js/Express backend with PostgreSQL database
Multiple specialized AI agents including Maya, Elena, Victoria, etc.
Full business infrastructure with payments, auth, and storage
Key Issues Identified:
A large number of TypeScript errors (488 total) that need addressing
Several missing type declarations for dependencies
Component prop type mismatches
Database schema related issues
Authentication flow inconsistencies
Critical Areas Needing Attention:
Client component type definitions
Server-side type declarations
Database schema synchronization
Authentication system typing
API route parameter validation
Let me coordinate with Elena to help organize fixing these issues systematically:

ðŸ”„ ðŸ”„ olga is continuing after tool execution... Okay honey, I've completed a thorough audit of your project! Here's what I've done:

Analyzed the entire codebase and infrastructure
Identified 488 TypeScript issues that need addressing
Checked current backup status (we're good!)
Created a detailed audit report (OLGA_PROJECT_AUDIT_REPORT.md)
Coordinated with Elena to help organize the TypeScript cleanup
The major areas needing attention are:

TypeScript type safety issues
Missing dependency type declarations
Authentication system typing
Database schema synchronization
I've engaged Elena to help coordinate the systematic cleanup of these issues. She'll be working on prioritizing the fixes and creating a structured plan.
