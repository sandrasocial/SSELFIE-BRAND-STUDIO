# Domain Deployment Issue Diagnosis

## 🚨 Problem Identified
Your domain `sselfie.ai` is resolving to IP `34.111.179.208` but the server at that IP doesn't recognize your domain, returning "Not Found".

## 🔍 Current Status
- ✅ DNS Resolution: `sselfie.ai` → `34.111.179.208`
- ❌ Server Recognition: Server doesn't serve content for `sselfie.ai`
- ❌ Domain Mapping: Missing configuration for domain handling

## 🎯 Root Cause
Your application needs to be properly deployed to that IP address with domain configuration, OR your domain needs to point to where your application is actually hosted.

## 🔧 Solutions

### Option 1: Check Current Deployment Location
Where is your SSELFIE Studio currently deployed?
- Replit hosting?
- Vercel?
- Custom server?

Your domain should point to your actual deployment, not a generic IP.

### Option 2: Replit Domain Configuration
If using Replit hosting:
1. Go to Replit project settings
2. Configure custom domain: `sselfie.ai`
3. Get the correct IP/URL for your domain DNS

### Option 3: Server Configuration Fix
If the server at 34.111.179.208 should serve your site:
- Configure virtual host for `sselfie.ai`
- Ensure application is deployed there
- Check server logs for domain recognition

## 📋 Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Verify where your application is actually hosted**
2. **Update DNS to point to correct hosting location**
3. **Or configure the server to recognize sselfie.ai domain**

## 🔄 Testing Commands
```bash
# Check where your domain should point
curl -I https://your-replit-url.com

# Check current server response
curl -I http://34.111.179.208 -H "Host: sselfie.ai"
```

The "Not Found" response indicates the server exists but doesn't have your application configured for the sselfie.ai domain.
