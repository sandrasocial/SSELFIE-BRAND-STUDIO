âœ… CONTEXT PRESERVATION FIX VERIFICATION

ISSUE: Agents losing context mid-task execution
CAUSE: Generic "Continue with your task" message erasing original context
SOLUTION: Removed problematic continuation logic

BEFORE:
- Agent gets task: "Create a test file"
- Agent executes tool successfully  
- System adds: "Continue with your task..."
- Agent: "Girl, looks like you haven't given me a specific task to work on yet!" ðŸ˜…

AFTER: 
- Agent gets task: "Create a test file"
- Agent executes tool successfully
- Agent maintains original context
- Agent: "I successfully created your test file as requested!"

Fixed in: server/services/claude-api-service-simple.ts
Lines removed: 193-196 (generic continuation message)
Result: Agents maintain task memory throughout tool execution
