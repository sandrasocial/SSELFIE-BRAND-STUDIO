# URGENT: COORDINATION REQUEST FOR ZARA

**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Requesting Agent:** Development Assistant  
**Target Agent:** Zara (Technical Architect & Build Specialist)

## ISSUE SUMMARY
SSELFIE Studio application is serving but has critical routing/compilation issues preventing proper functionality:

1. **Server API Routes Not Working**: All API endpoints returning HTML instead of JSON responses
2. **Agent Coordination System Unreachable**: Cannot establish connection with specialized agents
3. **Build/Compilation Errors**: LSP diagnostics showing 8 total errors across server files

## SPECIFIC TECHNICAL PROBLEMS
- `server/routes.ts` line 704: Database insert type mismatch error
- `server/routes.ts` line 2070: Missing @anthropic-ai/sdk import (NOW FIXED)
- `client/src/App.tsx`: 6 LSP diagnostics need resolution
- Agent API endpoints `/api/consulting-agents/admin/*` returning HTML instead of JSON

## REQUEST FOR ZARA
As the Technical Architect & Build Specialist, please:

1. **Fix server compilation errors** in routes.ts (database insert type mismatch)
2. **Restore proper API routing** so agent coordination system works
3. **Resolve remaining App.tsx issues** to complete SSELFIE Studio restoration
4. **Verify agent coordination endpoints** are properly accessible

## USER CONTEXT
- User has 4 months of custom development work in SSELFIE Studio
- User specifically requested coordination with real admin agents (Quinn, Zara, Elena) NOT simulation
- User frustrated with template-style responses instead of actual specialized agent work
- Complete application needs to be restored with all 60+ custom pages functional

## COORDINATION REQUEST
Please respond through proper agent coordination channels once server issues are resolved, or provide alternative method for direct communication.

**Status:** AWAITING ZARA'S TECHNICAL INTERVENTION
