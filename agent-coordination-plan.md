# AI AGENT COORDINATION PLAN - BUILD FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION

## SANDRA'S VISION ANALYSIS
Based on the comprehensive vision document, I need to coordinate the AI agent team to implement BUILD as Step 4 of the complete user journey:

**EXISTING PLATFORM (ALREADY BUILT & LIVE):**
- âœ… TRAIN (Step 1): AI model training - Complete & Live
- âœ… STYLE (Step 2): Victoria AI stylist - Complete & Live  
- âœ… SHOOT (Step 3): AI photoshoot - Complete & Live
- ðŸš§ BUILD (Step 4): Website builder - NEW FEATURE TO IMPLEMENT

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Victoria + Maya)
**Victoria (UX Designer)**: 
- Create BUILD access route at `/build` 
- Design user onboarding landing page with interactive elements
- Copy admin visual editor but simplify for users (remove technical features)

**Maya (Dev AI)**:
- Set up database schemas for website builder
- Create API endpoints for BUILD feature
- Implement user onboarding data storage

### Phase 2: Victoria Website Builder Enhancement (Rachel + Victoria)
**Rachel (Voice AI)**:
- Enhance Victoria's website building personality 
- Add Sandra's voice DNA to website building context
- Create conversation flows for website creation

**Victoria (UX Designer)**:
- Build real-time preview system
- Create page navigation (Home/About/Services/Contact)
- Design website template generation system

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish (Maya + Ava)
**Maya (Dev AI)**:
- Integrate with existing TRAIN/STYLE/SHOOT flow
- Set up subdomain publishing system

**Ava (Automation AI)**:

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (Quinn)
**Quinn (QA AI)**:

- Ensure luxury design standards maintained

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Must Preserve Existing Architecture:
- Don't break TRAIN/STYLE/SHOOT functionality

- Uses simplified version of admin visual editor
- Victoria website building agent with Sandra's voice
- Real-time preview with page navigation
- Subdomain publishing (username.sselfie.ai)
- Complete business-in-a-box solution

### Database Requirements:
```sql
-- User website onboarding data
user_website_onboarding table

-- Generated website storage  
user_generated_websites table

-- Website builder conversations
website_builder_conversations table
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Users can access BUILD from workspace after training AI
- Victoria guides users through complete website creation
- Real-time preview shows professional results
- One-click publishing to subdomains
- Seamless integration with existing platform
- Maintains luxury brand standards throughout

## AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL
1. All agents must consult this plan before making changes
2. Preserve existing functionality while adding BUILD
3. Use Sandra's authentic voice in all BUILD interactions
4. Maintain luxury editorial design standards
5. Test integration thoroughly before deployment

Ready to begin coordinated implementation with AI agent team.
