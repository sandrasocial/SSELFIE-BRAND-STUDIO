# SSELFIE Studio - Domain Access Troubleshooting Guide

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: DNS Configuration

### Problem
Users can access https://sselfie.ai when clicking links but NOT when manually typing the domain in browser address bar.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **DNS Resolution Issue**: `www.sselfie.ai` subdomain doesn't resolve (confirmed by curl test)
2. **Browser Caching**: Browsers may cache failed DNS lookups
3. **HTTPS Certificate**: May not cover www subdomain properly

### Technical Findings
- ✅ Main domain (sselfie.ai) returns HTTP 200
- ❌ www subdomain (www.sselfie.ai) returns "Could not resolve host"
- ✅ Server-side redirects configured correctly
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement working

### IMMEDIATE FIXES IMPLEMENTED

#### 1. Enhanced Server-Side Redirects
```javascript
// Enhanced domain handling in server/routes.ts
- Added debug logging for all domain access attempts
- Improved www → apex domain redirects
- Enhanced HTTPS enforcement
- Better cache headers for domain resolution
```

#### 2. Client-Side Domain Handling
```javascript
// Enhanced client-side redirects in App.tsx
- Force HTTPS redirect for sselfie.ai
- Handle www subdomain redirects
- Better error handling for domain issues
```

#### 3. Static File Configurations
- Created `.htaccess` for Apache servers
- Created `_redirects` for Netlify/Vercel deployments
- Added proper cache headers and security policies

### REQUIRED DNS FIXES (User Action Needed)

#### DNS Record Configuration
The domain registrar/DNS provider needs these records:

```
A Record:
Name: @
Value: [Replit deployment IP]

A Record: 
Name: www
Value: [Replit deployment IP]

OR

CNAME Record:
Name: www  
Value: sselfie.ai
```

#### SSL Certificate
Ensure SSL certificate covers both:
- sselfie.ai
- www.sselfie.ai

### USER INSTRUCTIONS

#### For End Users Having Access Issues:
1. **Type the full URL**: `https://sselfie.ai` (include https://)
2. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R
3. **Try incognito mode**: To bypass cached DNS
4. **Use different browser**: Chrome/Safari recommended
5. **Wait 5-10 minutes**: DNS propagation time

#### For Admin (Sandra):
1. **Check DNS records** with domain provider
2. **Verify SSL certificate** covers www subdomain  
3. **Test both domains**:
   - https://sselfie.ai ✅
   - https://www.sselfie.ai ❌ (needs DNS fix)

### MONITORING SOLUTION
Added comprehensive logging to track domain access issues:
- All domain requests logged with user agent
- Redirect attempts logged
- Failed DNS resolutions identified

### BUSINESS IMPACT
- Main domain (sselfie.ai) is fully functional
- Users who type domain manually may experience issues
- Clicking links works perfectly
- Social media shares work correctly

### NEXT STEPS
1. User should contact domain provider to fix www subdomain DNS
2. Monitor server logs for access patterns
3. Consider adding domain status page for transparency
