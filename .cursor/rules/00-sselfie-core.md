## üîÑ WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

### Branch Management
- Always create a new branch: `feat/{short-task}-{YYYYMMDD}`
- Example: `feat/maya-chat-improvements-20250118`

### Pre-PR Checks (MANDATORY)
Always run before creating PR:
```bash
pnpm i && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
```

### Environment Variables
- All env reads must go through `/server/config/env.ts`
- Update `.env.example` with any new variables
- Never commit actual secrets or API keys

### Code Reuse
- Search for existing utilities with `rg` before adding new ones
- Example: `rg "function.*validate" --type ts`
- Reuse existing patterns and components

### Feature Development
- New features must be behind feature flags
- All routes must be properly guarded with authentication
- Test on mobile devices (primary user base)
