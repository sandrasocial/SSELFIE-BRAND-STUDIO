description:Implement “Hair Stage Mode” (interactive presentation) — PHASE {1/2/3/4}

Context:
- We already have SecureIframe, MentimeterEmbed, CanvaEmbed, QR generator, LevelPartner webhook, Sophia trends, /hair route.
- Do not touch auth or core DB except new tables.
- Follow repo rules; open a feature branch; run full checks; open PR with demo GIF.

Deliver:
- Files, routes, and components as listed in phase {N} of the plan.
- Strict iframe sandbox + CSP; whitelist *.mentimeter.com and *.canva.com only.
- PresenterConsole (deck fullscreen + side poll/controls), AudienceClient (poll/CTA/QR).
- (Phase 2) Socket.IO realtime sync with room per session.
- (Phase 3) Analytics + LevelPartner enrichment + basic stats page.
- (Phase 4) WorkshopPane with Sophia trends and quick actions.

Acceptance:
- Fullscreen works reliably (Esc exits); Mentimeter/Canva render; QR links carry UTM.
- Realtime state mirrors under 200ms; reconnect ok.
- Analytics events persist and show up in /stats.
- All checks green; PR includes demo + test notes.
