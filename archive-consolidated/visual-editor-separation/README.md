# Visual Editor Separation Archive
## Date: January 25, 2025

This archive contains the admin Visual Editor components that were safely separated from the main SSELFIE STUDIO platform to prepare for launch.

## Visual Editor Access After Separation

### How to Restore Visual Editor:
1. Copy contents back from this archive to their original locations
2. Restore the admin route in `client/src/App.tsx`
3. Add Visual Editor link back to admin dashboard

### What Was Separated:
- `/client/src/components/visual-editor/` - All 30+ visual editor components
- `/client/src/pages/admin-visual-editor.tsx` - Admin visual editor page
- `/server/tools/` - File system integration tools
- Visual Editor admin route from server

### What Was Preserved:
- ✅ ALL BUILD feature components and functionality
- ✅ Maya and Victoria in BUILD context
- ✅ All member-facing agent functionality
- ✅ Core admin dashboard (without visual editor)
- ✅ Authentication and workspace features

### Safe Restoration:
All components are preserved and can be restored without any modifications needed.

## Architecture After Separation

### Main Branch (Production Ready):
- Landing page and authentication
- Workspace with 4-step journey
- Maya AI photography (member pages)
- Victoria coming soon (member pages)
- BUILD workspace (Step 4) - FULLY PRESERVED
- Payment processing
- Essential admin dashboard

### Visual Editor (Archived):
- Advanced development tools
- Multi-agent coordination system
- File system integration
- Admin development interface

This separation enables clean platform launch while preserving all Visual Editor functionality for post-launch development.
