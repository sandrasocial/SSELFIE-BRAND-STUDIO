## Basic model info

Model name: sandrasocial/sseelfie-ai
Model description: Your perfect AI brandphotoshoot using just your selfies


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Prompt for generated image. If you include the `trigger_word` used in the training process you are more likely to activate the trained object, style, or concept in the resulting image. (string)
- image (optional): Input image for image to image or inpainting mode. If provided, aspect_ratio, width, and height inputs are ignored. (string)
- mask (optional): Image mask for image inpainting mode. If provided, aspect_ratio, width, and height inputs are ignored. (string)
- aspect_ratio (optional): Aspect ratio for the generated image. If custom is selected, uses height and width below & will run in bf16 mode (string)
- height (optional): Height of generated image. Only works if `aspect_ratio` is set to custom. Will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16. Incompatible with fast generation (integer)
- width (optional): Width of generated image. Only works if `aspect_ratio` is set to custom. Will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16. Incompatible with fast generation (integer)
- prompt_strength (optional): Prompt strength when using img2img. 1.0 corresponds to full destruction of information in image (number)
- model (optional): Which model to run inference with. The dev model performs best with around 28 inference steps but the schnell model only needs 4 steps. (string)
- num_outputs (optional): Number of outputs to generate (integer)
- num_inference_steps (optional): Number of denoising steps. More steps can give more detailed images, but take longer. (integer)
- guidance_scale (optional): Guidance scale for the diffusion process. Lower values can give more realistic images. Good values to try are 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5 (number)
- seed (optional): Random seed. Set for reproducible generation (integer)
- output_format (optional): Format of the output images (string)
- output_quality (optional): Quality when saving the output images, from 0 to 100. 100 is best quality, 0 is lowest quality. Not relevant for .png outputs (integer)
- disable_safety_checker (optional): Disable safety checker for generated images. (boolean)
- go_fast (optional): Run faster predictions with model optimized for speed (currently fp8 quantized); disable to run in original bf16 (boolean)
- megapixels (optional): Approximate number of megapixels for generated image (string)
- lora_scale (optional): Determines how strongly the main LoRA should be applied. Sane results between 0 and 1 for base inference. For go_fast we apply a 1.5x multiplier to this value; we've generally seen good performance when scaling the base value by that amount. You may still need to experiment to find the best value for your particular lora. (number)
- extra_lora (optional): Load LoRA weights. Supports Replicate models in the format <owner>/<username> or <owner>/<username>/<version>, HuggingFace URLs in the format huggingface.co/<owner>/<model-name>, CivitAI URLs in the format civitai.com/models/<id>[/<model-name>], or arbitrary .safetensors URLs from the Internet. For example, 'fofr/flux-pixar-cars' (string)
- extra_lora_scale (optional): Determines how strongly the extra LoRA should be applied. Sane results between 0 and 1 for base inference. For go_fast we apply a 1.5x multiplier to this value; we've generally seen good performance when scaling the base value by that amount. You may still need to experiment to find the best value for your particular lora. (number)


## Model output schema

{
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri"
  },
  "title": "Output"
}

If the input or output schema includes a format of URI, it is referring to a file.
