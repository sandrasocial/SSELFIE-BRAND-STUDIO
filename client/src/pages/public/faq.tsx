    question: "Do I need to be good at tech to use SSELFIE?",
    answer: "Nope. If you can upload a photo and tap a button, you're more than qualified. I built this for women who'd rather spend time living than learning new software."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't look like an influencer?",
    answer: "Perfect. Me neither. SSELFIE is about real women, real stories, and real brands. No filters, no fake perfection, just you, showing up as her."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need professional photos?",
    answer: "Absolutely not. All you need is your phone and a little window light. I'll show you exactly how to take the selfies that work (even on a messy Monday)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just for coaches?",
    answer: "Nope. It's for anyone who wants to build a personal brand: coaches, service providers, product makers, or \"I'm not sure what I do yet\" types. If you want to be seen, you're in the right place."
  },
  {
    question: "How much time does this take?",
    answer: "You can go from first selfie to live landing page in under an hour. Most women do it between school drop-off and their third cup of coffee."
  },
  {
    question: "What do I get (like, actually)?",
    answer: "• Your own brand mood board (colors, fonts, vibe)\n• Magazine-worthy on-brand selfies (AI-powered, but still you)\n• A done-for-you landing page (with email capture & booking)\n• Your custom SSELFIE link\n• Optional: Downloadable guides and digital products, ready to sell or send"
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to change something later?",
    answer: "It's your brand. Change anything, anytime. Upload new selfies, switch up your colors, or update your offer whenever you want. No extra fees, no tech headaches."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my own domain?",
    answer: "For now, you get a custom sselfie.studio/yourname link. If you're craving a .com, DM me. We're working on it."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this monthly or one-time?",
    answer: "Membership is monthly, so you can update and keep everything fresh. Cancel anytime, no guilt, no drama."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I get stuck?",
    answer: "You won't. But if you do, I'm here. DM me on Instagram or use the contact page."
