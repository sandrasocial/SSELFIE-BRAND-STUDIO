`https://sselfie-training-zips.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/undefined/undefined_1752656115898.png`

## âœ… CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### **1. UNIFIED HIGH-QUALITY PARAMETERS**
Both Maya chat and AI photoshoot now use identical proven settings:

```typescript
guidance: 2.8           // âœ… Proven optimal from reference image ID 405
num_inference_steps: 40 // âœ… Perfect detail level from reference
lora_scale: 0.95        // âœ… Maximum personalization from reference  
output_quality: 95      // âœ… Professional quality from reference
```

### **2. PROFESSIONAL CAMERA EQUIPMENT INTEGRATION**
Added professional camera specifications that produced the best quality results:

**Maya Chat Enhancement:**
- âœ… `getRandomCameraEquipment()` function added to `server/ai-service.ts`
- âœ… High-quality prompt structure: `raw photo + camera equipment + natural daylight + professional photography`

**AI Photoshoot Enhancement:**
- âœ… `getRandomCameraEquipment()` function added to `server/image-generation-service.ts`
- âœ… Identical prompt structure for consistency across both services

**Professional Camera Equipment Library:**
- `shot on Leica Q2 with 28mm f/1.7 lens` (from reference image ID 405)
- `shot on Canon EOS R5 with 85mm f/1.4 lens` (from reference image ID 367)
- `shot on Sony A7R V with 24-70mm f/2.8 lens` (from reference image ID 373)
- `shot on Canon EOS R6 with 85mm f/1.2 lens` (from reference image ID 368)
- `shot on Canon EOS R5 with 70-200mm f/2.8 lens` (from reference image ID 370)

### **3. MAYA OPTIMIZATION SERVICE UPDATED**
Enhanced `MayaOptimizationService.getOptimizedParameters()`:

```typescript
// HIGH-QUALITY PARAMETERS from successful image ID 405
const highQualityParams = {
  guidance: 2.8,        // âœ… Proven optimal from reference image  
  inferenceSteps: 40,   // âœ… Perfect detail level from reference
  loraScale: 0.95,      // âœ… Maximum personalization from reference
  outputQuality: 95     // âœ… Professional quality from reference
};
```

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Maya Chat (server/ai-service.ts):**
- âœ… Updated `buildFluxPrompt()` to include professional camera equipment
- âœ… Enhanced prompt structure: `${triggerWord}, ${hairOptimizedPrompt}, ${cameraEquipment}, natural daylight, professional photography`
- âœ… Uses `MayaOptimizationService.getOptimizedParameters()` for consistent high-quality settings

### **AI Photoshoot (server/image-generation-service.ts):**
- âœ… Updated `generateAIImage()` to include professional camera equipment
- âœ… Enhanced prompt structure: `${triggerWord}, ${hairOptimizedPrompt}, ${cameraEquipment}, natural daylight, professional photography`
- âœ… Uses `MayaOptimizationService.getOptimizedParameters()` for consistent high-quality settings
