# üö® FLUX GUIDANCE EMERGENCY FIX - July 16, 2025

## **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

### **Root Cause: WRONG GUIDANCE SCALE FOR FLUX MODELS**
- **Problem**: Used `guidance: 0.9` thinking it was "maximum strength"
- **Reality**: FLUX models use **different guidance scaling** than other AI models
- **FLUX Range**: 1.0 to 4.0 (not 0.0 to 1.0 like some models)
- **Effect of 0.9**: **EXTREMELY LOW** guidance = weak prompt adherence = base model behavior

### **Why Images Were Still Bad Despite Individual Models**
- ‚úÖ **Architecture**: Individual user models were being used correctly
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: User 42585527 has valid trained model
- ‚ùå **Guidance**: 0.9 was so low that prompts were barely being followed
- **Result**: Individual models acting like base models due to weak guidance

### **FLUX Guidance Scale Explanation**
- **1.0**: Minimal prompt adherence (very loose interpretation)
- **2.0**: Moderate prompt adherence  
- **2.8**: Balanced natural results (previous working setting)
- **3.5**: Strong prompt adherence (new optimal setting)
- **4.0**: Maximum prompt adherence (may be too rigid)

### **Emergency Fix Applied**
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
guidance: 0.9, // This was causing base model behavior!

// AFTER (CORRECT):
guidance: 3.5, // Strong FLUX prompt adherence (FLUX range: 1-4, 3.5 = strong)
```

### **Files Updated**
1. **server/ai-service.ts**: Updated guidance from 0.9 to 3.5
2. **server/image-generation-service.ts**: Updated guidance from 0.9 to 3.5  
3. **CORE_ARCHITECTURE_IMMUTABLE_V2.md**: Updated documentation

### **Expected Results After Fix**
- **Individual models will now follow prompts properly**
- **Natural, realistic results with strong facial likeness**
- **No more base model behavior**
- **Proper utilization of user's trained model features**

### **Architecture Status**
- ‚úÖ Individual user models: WORKING CORRECTLY
- ‚úÖ Authentication: WORKING CORRECTLY  
- ‚úÖ Core architecture: FULLY COMPLIANT
- ‚úÖ Guidance scale: **NOW FIXED**

## **Status: FLUX GUIDANCE EMERGENCY FIX APPLIED ‚úÖ**

The system will now properly utilize individual user models with correct FLUX guidance scaling for realistic, personalized results.
