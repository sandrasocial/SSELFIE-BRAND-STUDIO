# AUTHENTICATION STABILITY DIAGNOSTIC REPORT
**Status: CRITICAL ISSUE INVESTIGATION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**Date: July 15, 2025**

## CURRENT ISSUE
Both development and production domains experiencing OAuth callback failure:
- OAuth code received successfully
- State verification failing: "Unable to verify authorization request state"
- Users redirected back to landing page instead of workspace

## TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
**OAuth Flow Analysis:**
1. ‚úÖ User clicks login ‚Üí OAuth redirect initiated
2. ‚úÖ Replit OAuth authentication successful  
3. ‚úÖ Authorization code returned to callback
4. ‚ùå **FAILURE**: State verification fails in passport strategy
5. ‚ùå **RESULT**: No user object created, redirect to landing page

**Root Cause Identified:**
OAuth state verification mechanism between session storage and callback verification is broken.

## FIXES APPLIED
1. **Enhanced Session Configuration**: 
   - `saveUninitialized: true` for OAuth state storage
   - `sameSite: 'lax'` for cross-site OAuth callbacks

2. **OAuth Strategy Enhancement**:
   - Added `passReqToCallback: false`
   - Added `skipUserProfile: true`
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

3. **Callback Improvements**:
   - Multiple authentication attempt approaches
   - Detailed error logging for state verification failures
   - Graceful fallback mechanisms

## NEXT STEPS REQUIRED
If authentication still fails after current fixes:
1. **Manual OAuth Code Exchange**: Implement direct token exchange
2. **Session Storage Investigation**: Check PostgreSQL session table
3. **Alternative Strategy**: Consider custom OAuth implementation
4. **Replit Support**: May need Replit team assistance for OAuth configuration

## STATUS
üîÑ **TESTING REQUIRED**: User needs to test authentication on both domains
üéØ **GOAL**: Successful login ‚Üí workspace redirect
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Platform launch blocked until authentication resolves
