Status: **ACTIVE AND READY FOR TESTING**

### ðŸŽ¯ What Was Implemented

**ENHANCED PARAMETERS WOW FACTOR SYSTEM:**
- âœ… Enhanced guidance: 3.5 (was 2.8) for ultra-sharp results
- âœ… Enhanced steps: 50 (was 35) for maximum detail quality  
- âœ… Enhanced quality: 100 (was 95) for maximum output quality
- âœ… Enhanced resolution: 1 megapixel for sharpest results
- âœ… Go Fast disabled: Full quality mode (no speed optimizations)

### ðŸ”¥ WOW Factor Enhancement Details

**Enhanced Generation Parameters:**
- **Guidance**: 3.5 (was 2.8) - 25% stronger prompt adherence
- **Steps**: 50 (was 35) - 43% more detail processing  
- **Quality**: 100 (was 95) - Maximum output quality
- **Resolution**: 1 megapixel - Maximum allowed resolution
- **Go Fast**: Disabled (was enabled) - Full quality mode

**V2 Architecture Enhancement:**
- **User Model**: Individual trained model (maintains perfect likeness)
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Added professional keywords for realism
- **Result**: User's likeness + Magazine-quality enhancement via parameters

### ðŸš€ Where It's Active

**BOTH GENERATION SYSTEMS ENHANCED:**

1. **Maya AI Chat** (`server/ai-service.ts`)
   - All Maya generations now use enhanced multi-LoRA system
   - When users chat with Maya for image generation

2. **AI Photoshoot** (`server/image-generation-service.ts`)
   - All photoshoot generations enhanced with realism LoRA
   - When users use the AI Photoshoot feature
