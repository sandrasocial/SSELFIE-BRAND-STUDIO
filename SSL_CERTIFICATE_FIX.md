# SSL Certificate Fix for SSELFIE Studio

## ðŸš¨ Problem Identified
Your SSL certificate is valid for `sselfie.ai` but NOT for `www.sselfie.ai`, causing "This connection is not private" warnings.

## âœ… Solution 1: Server-Side Redirect (Implemented)
I've updated the server to redirect ALL `www` traffic to the main domain BEFORE SSL certificate verification. This prevents the certificate mismatch error.

## ðŸ”§ Alternative Solution 2: SSL Certificate Update
If you want to support both domains, you need to update your SSL certificate to include both:
- `sselfie.ai` 
- `www.sselfie.ai`

### For Let's Encrypt certificates:
```bash
# If using certbot
certbot certonly --standalone -d sselfie.ai -d www.sselfie.ai

# Or if using automated deployment
# Update your SSL configuration to include both domains
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach
**Use Solution 1** (server redirect) because:
- No SSL certificate changes needed
- Consistent branding with single domain
- Better SEO (no duplicate content)
- Simpler maintenance

## ðŸ“‹ Testing After Deployment
1. Visit `https://www.sselfie.ai` â†’ Should redirect to `https://sselfie.ai`
2. Visit `https://sselfie.ai` â†’ Should load without SSL warnings
3. Test in multiple browsers to confirm fix

## ðŸ”„ Certificate Details
Current certificate:
- **Domain**: sselfie.ai (only)
- **Issuer**: Let's Encrypt
- **Valid**: Jul 14 2025 - Oct 12 2025
- **Missing**: www.sselfie.ai coverage

The server-side redirect solution bypasses this limitation by ensuring users never hit the SSL certificate for www subdomain.
