# SSELFIE STUDIO Storage Testing Guide

## Testing Infrastructure Overview

"Let's make sure this flows naturally from section to section" - Our testing infrastructure is designed to ensure reliable and consistent image storage operations across the SSELFIE STUDIO platform.

### Recommended Testing Framework

We use Python's unittest framework with the following additional tools:
- **moto**: For mocking AWS S3 services
- **PIL**: For image manipulation and testing
- **pytest**: For advanced testing features and better reporting
- **coverage.py**: For tracking test coverage

### Best Practices for Storage Testing

1. **Isolation**
   - Use moto for S3 mocking
   - Create fresh bucket instances for each test
   - Clean up all test data after each run

2. **Mock Data Management**
   - Use MockImageGenerator for consistent test data
   - Maintain various image sizes and formats
   - Store test fixtures separately from test code

3. **Migration Testing**
   - Create versioned backup before migration
   - Test both up and down migrations
   - Verify data integrity post-migration
   - Include rollback procedures

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with various image sizes
   - Monitor upload/download speeds
   - Verify concurrent operations
   - Test batch processing capabilities

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Individual storage operations
   - Error handling
   - Input validation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end workflows
   - API interactions
   - Cross-service functionality

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Load testing
   - Stress testing
   - Scalability verification

### Migration Testing Strategy

1. **Pre-Migration**
   - Full data backup
   - Verify source data integrity
   - Document current state

2. **During Migration**
   - Progressive data transfer
   - Continuous validation
   - Error logging
   - Rollback points

3. **Post-Migration**
   - Data verification
   - Performance validation
   - User acceptance testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/storage

# Run with coverage
coverage run -m pytest tests/storage
coverage report
```

### Continuous Integration

Include these tests in CI/CD pipeline:
```yaml
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pip install -r requirements-test.txt
    - python -m pytest tests/storage
    - coverage run -m pytest tests/storage
    - coverage report
  artifacts:
    reports:
      coverage: coverage.xml
```
