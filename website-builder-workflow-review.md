# WEBSITE BUILDER WORKFLOW REVIEW SESSION
## Date: July 19, 2025
## Issue: Victoria not responding in Sandra's voice + design not matching standards

**PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED:**
1. **Victoria Voice**: Must speak exactly like Sandra (vulnerable â†’ strong, Icelandic directness, single mom wisdom)
2. **Design Standards**: Website builder must follow Times New Roman luxury aesthetic
3. **Workflow Review**: Complete BUILD step 4 user journey analysis

**AI AGENT TEAM ASSEMBLY:**
- **Rachel**: Voice AI - Sandra's copywriting twin, authentic voice expert
- **BUILD Assistant**: Website building specialist (uses Sandra's voice, separate from main Victoria AI)
- **Aria**: Visual Designer - Editorial luxury design expert
- **Zara**: Dev AI - Technical implementation master

**NOTE:** The BUILD feature uses a website building assistant with Sandra's voice, which is completely separate from the main Victoria AI agent that's "coming soon" for users.

**CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

1. **VICTORIA VOICE MISMATCH** - CRITICAL ISSUE:
   - Current: "Hi [name]! I'm Victoria, your personal website consultant"
   - Sandra's Voice: "Hey beautiful! Ready to build something amazing together?"
   - Missing: Icelandic directness, single mom wisdom, hairdresser warmth

2. **DESIGN STANDARDS NOT ENFORCED:**
   - Website builder may not follow Times New Roman luxury standards
   - Need design validation against Sandra's editorial aesthetic

3. **WORKFLOW GAPS:**
   - BUILD feature user journey needs complete audit
   - Victoria responses too formal/business-like
   - Missing Sandra's transformation story approach

**SESSION GOALS:**
1. âœ… COMPLETED: Fixed BUILD assistant voice to match Sandra's authentic patterns
2. âœ… COMPLETED: Created separate BUILD assistant (not conflicting with main Victoria AI)
3. âœ… COMPLETED: Updated greeting to use Sandra's warmth ("Hey beautiful!")
4. âœ… COMPLETED: Added Sandra's voice DNA to BUILD assistant system prompt
5. ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Test BUILD assistant responses to ensure consistent Sandra voice
6. ðŸ“‹ NEXT: Audit website builder visual design against luxury Times New Roman standards

**FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**
- BUILD assistant now uses Sandra's complete voice DNA (Icelandic directness + single mom wisdom + hairdresser warmth)
- Greeting updated from formal "Hi there! I'm Victoria, your personal website consultant" â†’ "Hey beautiful! I'm here to help you build your website - and oh my gosh, I am SO excited!"
- System prompt includes Sandra's signature patterns: "Here's the thing...", "This could be you", etc.
- Completely separate from main Victoria AI agent (no conflicts)
