# WEBSITE BUILDER WORKFLOW REVIEW SESSION
## Date: July 19, 2025
## Issue: Victoria not responding in Sandra's voice + design not matching standards

**PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED:**
1. **Victoria Voice**: Must speak exactly like Sandra (vulnerable â†’ strong, Icelandic directness, single mom wisdom)
2. **Design Standards**: Website builder must follow Times New Roman luxury aesthetic
3. **Workflow Review**: Complete BUILD step 4 user journey analysis

**AI AGENT TEAM ASSEMBLY:**
- **Rachel**: Voice AI - Sandra's copywriting twin, authentic voice expert
- **Victoria**: UX Designer - Landing page builder specialist  
- **Aria**: Visual Designer - Editorial luxury design expert
- **Zara**: Dev AI - Technical implementation master

**CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

1. **VICTORIA VOICE MISMATCH** - CRITICAL ISSUE:
   - Current: "Hi [name]! I'm Victoria, your personal website consultant"
   - Sandra's Voice: "Hey beautiful! Ready to build something amazing together?"
   - Missing: Icelandic directness, single mom wisdom, hairdresser warmth

2. **DESIGN STANDARDS NOT ENFORCED:**
   - Website builder may not follow Times New Roman luxury standards
   - Need design validation against Sandra's editorial aesthetic

3. **WORKFLOW GAPS:**
   - BUILD feature user journey needs complete audit
   - Victoria responses too formal/business-like
   - Missing Sandra's transformation story approach

**SESSION GOALS:**
1. Review Victoria's current personality/voice settings
2. Audit website builder visual design against Sandra's standards  
3. Create improved workflow for authentic Sandra voice in Victoria
4. Ensure BUILD feature matches luxury editorial aesthetic throughout
