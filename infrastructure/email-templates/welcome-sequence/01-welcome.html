        <p style="margin: 0 0 20px 0; font-size: 16px;">Hi there,</p>
        
        <p style="margin: 0 0 20px 0;">I'm genuinely excited you've decided to invest in your personal brand transformation. This isn't about building a business or becoming an influencer - this is about finally getting the recognition your expertise deserves.</p>
        
        <p style="margin: 0 0 20px 0;">You know that frustrating feeling when someone with half your experience gets the opportunities you should have? When your brilliant insights get overlooked in meetings? When you watch others build authority in your field while you stay invisible?</p>
        
        <p style="margin: 0 0 20px 0;">That ends now.</p>
        
        <p style="margin: 0 0 20px 0;">Over the next few days, I'll share exactly how to position your unique expertise so it gets noticed, respected, and remembered. No generic advice - just strategic insights that work for professionals who know their stuff but struggle to communicate their value.</p>
