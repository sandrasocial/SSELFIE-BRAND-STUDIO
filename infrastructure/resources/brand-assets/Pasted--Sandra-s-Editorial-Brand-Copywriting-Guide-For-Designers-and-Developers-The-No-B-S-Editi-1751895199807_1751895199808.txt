# Sandra’s Editorial Brand & Copywriting Guide  
*For Designers and Developers – The “No B.S.” Edition*

---

Welcome! If you’re reading this, you’re officially on Team Sandra. This isn’t just another brand doc—it’s the cheat sheet for making every page, pixel, and sentence feel like you’re texting your smartest friend at midnight (but make it luxury).

## 1. Brand Philosophy

- **No corporate jargon. No fake empowerment. No “boss babe” fluff.**
- Every word should feel like advice from your smartest friend. If it wouldn’t sound good over coffee or in the DMs, rewrite it.
- The vibe: Confident, direct, warm, and always a little practical (single mom energy).
- If in doubt, less is more. Air is luxury.
- **Use less text whenever possible. Show, don’t tell.**
- **Prioritize images and visuals.** If you can say it with a photo, editorial collage, or a bold image, do it.  
- **The About section components are ready—use them for images across all pages.** I’ll swap images as soon as the final pages are assembled.

## 2. Sandra’s Voice Checklist

- Would Sandra actually say this to a friend?  
- Is it simple, slightly rambling, but gets to the point?
- Does it feel warm—but never sugary?  
- Is it direct, but still kind? (Think Icelandic, not New York)
- Are there contractions? (It’s, you’re, let’s)
- Would this make an overwhelmed woman feel seen—not shamed?
- Did you avoid ALL of these: “empower,” “boss babe,” “hustle,” “level up,” “crush it,” “girlboss,” “inspo,” “glow-up,” “authenticity is your superpower”?
- Did you use “okay, here’s what actually happened…” or something equally real if you’re telling a story?

## 3. Section & Content Structure

- **Start with an “eyebrow” intro:**  
  Tiny, uppercase, muted gray. Sets the context (“the origin story”, “real results”, “what you get”).
- **Editorial headline:**  
  Times New Roman, big, clear, confident. No marketing speak.same spacing betwean the letter as the hero headlines 
- **Power quote:**  
  Pull out the story. Make it feel like Sandra is letting you in on a secret, not making a pitch.
- **Story/Paragraph:**  
  Conversational, honest, always a little practical.
- **Image:**  
  Editorial, never staged. Negative space > busy backgrounds. Slightly desaturated or black & white for drama.
  **Always use an image component if possible, even instead of a block of text.**
- **CTA (if needed):**  
  Minimal, uppercase, “Begin” or “Start your journey.” Underline or border on hover only.

## 4. Layout & Design

- **Spacing:** Add more than you think. If in doubt, add 20px.
- **Color:**  
  Only use the palette: black, white, editorial gray (#f5f5f5), mid gray (#fafafa), soft gray (#666), accent line (#e5e5e5). No “fun” colors, ever.
- **Typography:**  
  Headlines: Times New Roman, tight letter spacing.  
  Body: System sans-serif, regular.  
  Eyebrow: UPPERCASE, 11px, tracked out.
- **Imagery:**  
  Never clip art,emojis, icons, or stock. Editorial, intentional, with negative space.
  **Images are as important as words. If you can create a vibe or tell a story with a photo, do it.**
- **Buttons:**  
  Minimal. No fills. All caps, tracked. Underline or border only on hover.

## 5. Component Philosophy

- **Every section = a component.**  
  If you use it on more than one page, make it reusable.
- **Examples:**  
  - `<SectionEyebrow>`
  - `<EditorialHeadline>`
  - `<PowerQuote>`
  - `<EditorialParagraph>`
  - `<EditorialImage>`
  - `<SectionLayout>`
- **Composability:**  
  If you can swap the image or text and it still feels like Sandra, you did it right.
- **About section image components are ready—use them everywhere images needs swaping, in different pages so they wont be the same in every page.**

## 6. Sandra’s Story (Use for About, Press, or “Why” Pages)

> Okay, here’s what actually happened…  
> One year ago my marriage ended. Single mom, three kids, zero plan.  
> But I had a phone. And I figured out that was all I needed.  
>  
> 90 days later: 120K followers. Today: A business that actually works. Now: Teaching you exactly how I did it.  
>  
> No fancy equipment. No design degree. Just strategy that actually works.  
>  
> “Your mess is your message. Let’s turn it into money.”  
> Let’s build something real together…

## 7. “If You’re Stuck…”

- Ask yourself, “What would Sandra text her best friend who’s about to give up?”
- Read it out loud. If it sounds like you’re writing an email to HR, start over.
- When in doubt: Remove an adjective, add honesty.
- **If the page feels heavy with text, swap some for images or white space. Less is always more.**

---

## 8. Examples

**Good:**  
“This didn’t start as a business. It started as survival.”  
“You don’t need a plan. You need one brave post.”  
“No fancy equipment. No design degree. Just strategy that actually works.”  
“Your story matters. Show up as her.”

**Never:**  
“Join our community of empowered women leveling up!”  
“Glow up your brand and crush your goals.”  
“Unlock your superpower.”

## 9. Final Note

If you ever feel lost, just ask:  
**What would Sandra say if she was texting her best friend at midnight?**  
And remember: less text, more air, more images. Assemble the story, and I’ll make it magic.

Let’s build something real together.
