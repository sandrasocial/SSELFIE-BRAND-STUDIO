# SSELFIE STUDIO: Build Your Brand. Start With a Selfie.

Okay, here’s what actually happened—

I built SSELFIE STUDIO for women who are starting over. Women who want to show up, get seen, and finally feel like the main character in their own story.

This isn’t about the perfect photos. It’s about your personal brand, built on your best selfies (and a little AI magic).

## How It Works

1. **Upload your selfies**  
   10–15 photos. You get a dead-simple tutorial: “Face the window, wear what you love, no need for a ring light.”

2. **Pick your vibe**  
   Choose your niche, your look, even your “dream client” mood.

3. **Watch the magic**  
   My custom SSELFIE AI model (yes, brag-worthy) creates a gallery of editorial, on-brand images instantly. No more waiting weeks for a photoshoot.

4. **One-Click Studio Setup**  
   - Choose your favorite images, be your own editor-in-chief.
   - Pick your luxury SSELFIE layout (not “template”—editorial, not generic).
   - Plug in your story, your offers, and your ‘why’ (with prompts and AI to help in your voice).
   - If you can text, you can do this.

5. **Everything falls into place**  
   - Your best SSELFIEs drop right into every page: hero, about, services, call-to-action.
   - All the copy is there, in your voice, pulled from your answers and story.
   - Booking, payments, and links? Connect with one click. Stripe, Calendly, whatever.
   - Your dashboard is as simple as:  
     1. Connect Stripe  
     2. Add services  
     3. Share your page (`sselfie.ai/yourname`)
   - Want new images next month? Just upload, click, done.

## Why SSELFIE?

Because you don’t need a branding agency.
You don’t need a tech degree.
You just need your face, your story, and about twenty minutes.

**Imagine:**  
Your dream client lands on your page and sees the real you. Not a stock photo, not Canva clipart—but your best self. They know exactly who you are, what you offer, and how to book you.

This is “personal brand” for women who don’t have time for BS.

## Taglines / Headlines

- “The Personal brand builder that starts with a selfie.”
- “This is why it’s called SSELFIE.”
- “Show up as her. Build your studio in minutes.”
- “One upload, one click, one real brand — yours.”

## SSELFIE STUDIO Pricing Strategy

### 1. Lead with the Transformation, Not the Features

- They’re not paying for “pages” or “images.”
- They’re paying for that “I can’t believe that’s me” moment—plus the ease of never having to Google “how do I connect Stripe?” again.
- Price the whole transformation, not the parts.

### 2. Offer Two Clear Paths

#### A. SSELFIE STUDIO Membership

For women who want the full experience:  
The AI SSELFIE tool, luxury studio, booking/payments, dashboard, PDF product, updates, Sandra AI chat—the works.

- **Founding Member Launch (first 100):**  
  €97/month (lock it in, price goes up later. Feels exclusive, gets your first testimonials, rewards your day-ones.)
- **Standard Monthly:**  
  €147/month (everything included, cancel anytime.)
- **Annual Plan:**  
  €1297/year (save 3 months, for the serious ones.)

**What’s inside:**
- Unlimited AI SSELFIE generations
- Luxury landing page (hosted on sselfie.ai)
- Booking, payment, and PDF guide setup
- Sandra AI chat
- Monthly updates (new templates, new features, etc.)
- Priority support

#### B. SSELFIE AI PACK—One-Time AI Image Pack

For the “I just want the selfies” crowd.

- **Single SSELFIE AI Pack:**  
  €47 one-time
  - Upload 10–15 selfies
  - Get 30 AI-edited luxury images
  - No studio page, just the images
  - If they upgrade to Studio, this price is credited

### 3. Why These Numbers?

- €97–147/month is in the sweet spot for women investing in their brand (but not ready for agency pricing).
- €47 one-time is a no-brainer for anyone curious, wants to try your method, or isn’t ready to commit.

### 4. How to Present It

- “Look, I know you’re tired of subscriptions. But you’re not paying for another tool. You’re investing in finally being seen, booked, and paid as yourself.”
- “If you’re not ready for the full studio, just grab your SSELFIE images. Try it, see the magic. Come back when you’re ready for the real deal.”

### 5. Upsells, Add-ons, and Future Stuff

- Add “Template Packs,” “Seasonal Updates,” or “1:1 Strategy Calls” later.
- For now: focus on getting every new member to their “I’m live and I love it” moment in under 30 minutes.

**TL;DR:**  
Keep it simple. Make the transformation the center.  
Reward action-takers.  
And always price based on the “I can’t believe that’s me” moment.
