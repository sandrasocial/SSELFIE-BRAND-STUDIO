  "description": "Hi Sandra! I've been analyzing your current admin dashboard and I see huge potential for improvement.\n\nYour current dashboard has information scattered across multiple pages, making it hard to get a quick business overview. I want to create a luxury command center that feels like Vogue meets Tesla - elegant but powerful.\n\n**Key improvements I'm proposing:**\nâ€¢ Single-page overview with key metrics at the top\nâ€¢ Beautiful data visualization for user growth, revenue, AI generations\nâ€¢ Quick action tiles for common tasks (user management, agent commands)\nâ€¢ Elegant conversation interface for chatting with your agent team\nâ€¢ Mobile-responsive design that works on your phone\n\nThis will save you 10+ clicks per day and give you that \"expensive software\" feeling that matches your brand.",
  "reasoning": "Your business is scaling rapidly and you need a dashboard that can keep up. Right now you're clicking through 4-5 different pages just to get a daily business overview.\n\nAs a luxury brand founder, your tools should feel as premium as your product. The current dashboard feels functional but not inspiring - it doesn't match the SSELFIE brand aesthetic.\n\nI've studied dashboards from companies like Stripe, Notion, and Figma. They all share common patterns: immediate value on first glance, beautiful data presentation, and intuitive navigation.",
  "impact": "â€¢ **Time Savings**: Reduce daily admin time from 30 minutes to 10 minutes\nâ€¢ **Better Decisions**: See trends and patterns at a glance\nâ€¢ **Confidence Boost**: Dashboard that feels as premium as your brand\nâ€¢ **Mobile Management**: Run your business from anywhere\nâ€¢ **Agent Integration**: Seamless communication with your AI team",
