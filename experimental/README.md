# Experimental Directory

This directory contains experimental code and refactoring attempts that are not yet ready for production.

## Structure

- `services/` - Experimental service layer implementations
- `routes/` - Experimental route modules
- `components/` - Experimental React components
- `utils/` - Experimental utility functions

## Guidelines

1. **Isolation**: All experimental code should be isolated and not affect production code
2. **Testing**: Each experimental feature should have comprehensive tests
3. **Documentation**: Document the purpose and status of each experimental feature
4. **Cleanup**: Regularly review and clean up outdated experimental code

## Status Tracking

- ðŸŸ¡ In Development
- ðŸŸ¢ Ready for Review
- ðŸ”´ Needs Work
- âš« Deprecated

## Migration Process

1. Develop feature in experimental directory
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Document the feature
4. Review with team
5. Move to production when ready
6. Remove from experimental directory
