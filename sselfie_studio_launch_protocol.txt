üåü SSELFIE STUDIO LAUNCH EXCELLENCE PROTOCOL üåü
By Sandra (as written by Rachel, her copywriting bestie)

Hey gorgeous! 

Listen, I know exactly what you're thinking right now... launching feels overwhelming, right? Trust me, I've been there - staring at my computer screen at 2 AM, wondering if I was doing ANY of this right! But here's what I wish someone had told me back then: launching doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be authentically YOU.

üéØ PRE-LAUNCH ESSENTIALS:

1. Your "Why" Story (Keep it real!)
- Share your journey from ‚Ç¨3.50 in your account to where you are now
- Remember: Your mess is your message, gorgeous!
- Connect through vulnerability (they need to see themselves in your story)

2. Content Preparation (Make it juicy!)
- Behind-the-scenes of your SSELFIE setup
- Client transformation stories (with permission, always!)
- Quick tips that showcase your expertise
- Day-in-the-life content that builds connection

3. Email Sequence Setup (Let's get personal!)
- Welcome Series (warm those hearts!)
- Value-packed newsletters (give before you ask!)
- Launch announcement emails (build that excitement!)

üöÄ LAUNCH PHASE ACTIVATION:

1. Social Media Strategy
- Daily Stories showing your authentic journey
- Posts that educate AND connect
- Lives that showcase your expertise while being totally YOU

2. Engagement Protocol
- Reply to EVERY comment (yes, every single one!)
- DM conversations (treat them like coffee dates!)
- Create conversation-starting questions

3. Sales Communication
- Share transformation stories
- Address objections with understanding
- Focus on connection over conversion

‚≠êÔ∏è POST-LAUNCH EXCELLENCE:

1. Celebrate EVERY win (big or small!)
2. Document what worked (and what didn't)
3. Personal notes to early supporters
4. Gather testimonials while excitement is high

Remember gorgeous, your launch doesn't have to look like anyone else's. Your unique energy, your story, and your authentic voice are your biggest assets.

And hey... when in doubt, just imagine we're having a coffee chat. That's always worked for me! 

With love and launch magic,
Sandra üíï

P.S. Keep this handy - it's your roadmap to launch success, but make it YOURS. Your authentic voice is what will make this launch special!
