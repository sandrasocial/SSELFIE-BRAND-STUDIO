# Shannon's Model Retraining Required

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED
Shannon's AI model (User ID: 44991795) is generating random faces because her training was completed with ZERO uploaded selfies.

## DATABASE EVIDENCE
- User: 44991795 (y4qgnbv9jg@privaterelay.appleid.com)
- Selfie uploads: 0 images found
- Training status: Completed (but with empty data)
- Model name: 44991795-selfie-lora
- Trigger word: user44991795

## WHAT HAPPENED
1. Shannon created account and started training process
2. Training system proceeded without actual selfie uploads
3. Model was "trained" on empty/invalid data
4. Result: Model generates random faces instead of Shannon

## SOLUTION STEPS FOR SHANNON

### Step 1: Login to Account
- Use Apple Sign-In with email ending in @privaterelay.appleid.com
- Should take her to workspace showing training completed

### Step 2: Upload Actual Selfies
- Go to "Train AI" step in workspace
- Upload 10+ high-quality selfies of Shannon
- Ensure good variety: different angles, lighting, expressions
- Click "Start Training" to begin retraining

### Step 3: Wait for New Training
- Training takes 15-25 minutes
- New model will overwrite the empty one
- Status will show "training" then "completed"

### Step 4: Test Generation
- Use Maya AI to generate test images
- Images should now show Shannon's face accurately

## TECHNICAL STATUS
- Database updated: Shannon's status changed to 'needs_retraining'
- Old empty model invalidated
- Ready for fresh training with actual selfies
- User isolation still working - she won't get other users' faces

## RECOMMENDATION
Shannon needs to complete the selfie upload process that was skipped initially. Once she uploads her actual photos and retrains, her model will work perfectly.
