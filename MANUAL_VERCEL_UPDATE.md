# MANUAL VERCEL.JSON UPDATE REQUIRED

## ISSUE
Git push operations are failing due to network/authentication issues. The deployment configuration needs to be manually updated.

## SOLUTION
Manually replace your vercel.json file on GitHub with this exact content:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist/public"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/index.js"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## STEPS TO UPDATE
1. Go to https://github.com/sandrasocial/SSELFIE
2. Click on vercel.json file
3. Click "Edit this file" (pencil icon)
4. Replace entire content with the JSON above
5. Commit with message: "Fix Vercel deployment - static build configuration"

## VERIFICATION
After updating, your Vercel deployment should work correctly. The build will create the dist/public directory and deploy successfully.
