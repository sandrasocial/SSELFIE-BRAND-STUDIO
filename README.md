### 🔒 Critical Rules
1. **NEVER modify Maya's revenue systems during development**
2. **Test new features separately before integration**  
3. **Use Elena for strategic coordination, Zara for technical implementation**
4. **Maya Personal Branding can launch TODAY with existing systems**

### 🏃‍♂️ For New Agents
1. **Read this README first** to understand the business
2. **Check `docs/replit.md`** for detailed architecture
3. **Maya generates income** - protect her systems at all costs
4. **Build in safe zones** - don't break what's working
