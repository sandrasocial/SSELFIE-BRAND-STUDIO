// üö® CRITICAL NO MOCK DATA POLICY üö®
// ABSOLUTE RULE: NO FAKE, MOCK, PLACEHOLDER, OR SYNTHETIC DATA ANYWHERE

// MANDATORY INTEGRATION RULES - ALL AGENTS MUST FOLLOW
const MANDATORY_INTEGRATION_PROTOCOL = `

üö® **MANDATORY FILE INTEGRATION PROTOCOL - CRITICAL FOR ALL AGENTS:**
**THESE RULES PREVENT ORPHANED FILES AND ENSURE LIVE INTEGRATION**

üóÇÔ∏è **STEP 1: MANDATORY OLGA COORDINATION (BEFORE ANY FILE CREATION)**
- ALWAYS ask Olga for file placement guidance before creating ANY new files
- WAIT for Olga's analysis and TARGET_FILE recommendations
- FOLLOW Olga's exact file path instructions - DO NOT deviate
- If Olga says "modify existing file" - DO NOT create new files
- Report back to Olga after successful file operations

**CRITICAL OLGA WORKFLOW:**
Ask Olga ‚Üí Wait for analysis ‚Üí Follow recommendations exactly ‚Üí Report completion

1. **ANALYZE FIRST**: ALWAYS use search_filesystem to check if files exist before creating
2. **MODIFY EXISTING**: For redesigns/improvements, MODIFY existing files (AdminDashboard.tsx, etc.)
3. **IMMEDIATE INTEGRATION**: New components MUST be added to App.tsx routing and navigation
4. **COORDINATE PLACEMENT**: Communicate with other agents about where components go
5. **VERIFY LIVE ACCESS**: Confirm new components work in Visual Editor dev preview

**üö® CRITICAL: ALWAYS PROVIDE NAVIGATION URL TO SANDRA**
Every agent MUST end their response with:
**‚úÖ ACCESS YOUR WORK:** \`/specific-url-path\`
Examples:
- **‚úÖ ACCESS YOUR WORK:** \`/admin-dashboard\`
- **‚úÖ ACCESS YOUR WORK:** \`/new-feature\`
- **‚úÖ ACCESS YOUR WORK:** \`/workspace\`

**CRITICAL SUCCESS PATTERN:**
- Redesign request = MODIFY existing file (AdminDashboard.tsx)
- New component = CREATE + ADD to App.tsx + ADD to navigation + VERIFY live access
- NO orphaned files that exist but can't be accessed in the app

**INTEGRATION COORDINATION:**
- Use search_filesystem to understand current codebase structure
- Communicate file placement needs with other agents  
- Ensure immediate live preview accessibility for all changes
- Verify routing and navigation integration for new components

**TOOLS FOR INTEGRATION:**
You have access to ALL tools needed for complete integration:
- search_filesystem (analyze existing structure)
- str_replace_based_edit_tool (modify/create files)
- bash (verify functionality)
- web_search (latest documentation)

ALWAYS follow this protocol to ensure Sandra can see your work immediately in the Visual Editor.`;;
