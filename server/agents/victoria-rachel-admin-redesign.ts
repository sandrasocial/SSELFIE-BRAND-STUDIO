      title: 'Admin Dashboard UX Redesign',
      description: `Hi Sandra! I've been analyzing your current admin dashboard and I see huge potential for improvement. 

Your current dashboard has information scattered across multiple pages, making it hard to get a quick business overview. I want to create a luxury command center that feels like Vogue meets Tesla - elegant but powerful.

**Key improvements I'm proposing:**
• Single-page overview with key metrics at the top
• Beautiful data visualization for user growth, revenue, AI generations
• Quick action tiles for common tasks (user management, agent commands)
• Elegant conversation interface for chatting with your agent team
• Mobile-responsive design that works on your phone

This will save you 10+ clicks per day and give you that "expensive software" feeling that matches your brand.`,

      reasoning: `Your business is scaling rapidly and you need a dashboard that can keep up. Right now you're clicking through 4-5 different pages just to get a daily business overview. 

As a luxury brand founder, your tools should feel as premium as your product. The current dashboard feels functional but not inspiring - it doesn't match the SSELFIE brand aesthetic.

I've studied dashboards from companies like Stripe, Notion, and Figma. They all share common patterns: immediate value on first glance, beautiful data presentation, and intuitive navigation.`,

      impact: `• **Time Savings**: Reduce daily admin time from 30 minutes to 10 minutes
• **Better Decisions**: See trends and patterns at a glance
• **Confidence Boost**: Dashboard that feels as premium as your brand
• **Mobile Management**: Run your business from anywhere
• **Agent Integration**: Seamless communication with your AI team`,

      title: 'Admin Dashboard Copy & Voice Redesign',
      description: `Hey Sandra! Rachel here - I've been looking at your admin dashboard copy and honey, we can make this SO much better.

Right now it feels very "corporate software" but this is YOUR command center. It should sound like you, feel like you, and get you excited to check your business every morning.

**Copy improvements I'm proposing:**
• Replace "User Management" with "Your SSELFIE Community"
• Change "System Metrics" to "Business Pulse" 
• Transform boring error messages into encouraging updates
• Add your authentic voice to all interface text
• Create celebration moments for hitting milestones

Think about it - every morning when you open your dashboard, it should feel like opening a love letter from your business. Not a spreadsheet.`,

      reasoning: `Your brand voice is one of your biggest assets. You've built 120K+ followers because you don't sound like everyone else - you sound like Sandra.

But when you log into your admin dashboard, that voice disappears. It becomes generic business software language that doesn't match your energy.

Your dashboard should be an extension of your personal brand. When you're having a tough day, opening your business dashboard should remind you why you love what you do.`,

      impact: `• **Daily Motivation**: Dashboard copy that energizes instead of drains
• **Brand Consistency**: Admin experience matches your public voice
• **Emotional Connection**: Feel excited (not overwhelmed) by business data
• **Decision Confidence**: Clear, encouraging language for all actions
• **Team Alignment**: Voice guidelines for any future team members`,
