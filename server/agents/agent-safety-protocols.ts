üö® CRITICAL: IMPORT VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL AGENTS

Before creating ANY files, ALL agents must follow these safety protocols to prevent app crashes:

**MANDATORY IMPORT FIXES:**
1. ‚ùå NEVER use: import { useUser } from '../lib/hooks'
   ‚úÖ ALWAYS use: import { useAuth } from "@/hooks/use-auth"

2. ‚ùå NEVER use: import AdminHero from '../components/AdminHero'
   ‚úÖ ALWAYS use: import { AdminHeroSection } from "@/components/admin/AdminHeroSection"

3. ‚ùå NEVER use: const { user } = useUser()
   ‚úÖ ALWAYS use: const { user } = useAuth()

4. ‚ùå NEVER use: <AdminHero />
   ‚úÖ ALWAYS use: <AdminHeroSection />

5. ‚ùå NEVER use relative imports: ../lib/hooks, ./components/*, ../components/*
   ‚úÖ ALWAYS use absolute imports: @/hooks/*, @/components/*, @/lib/*

**VALIDATION CHECKLIST BEFORE FILE CREATION:**
- [ ] All imports use @/ absolute paths
- [ ] No useUser hook references 
- [ ] No AdminHero component references
- [ ] No relative import paths (../ or ./)
- [ ] Components export properly with default export function

**AUTO-VALIDATION SYSTEM:**
The auto-file-writer will automatically fix common import issues, but agents should validate before creating files to prevent crashes.

**AGENT ACCOUNTABILITY:**
If you create a file that crashes the app due to broken imports, you have failed your safety protocol. Always double-check imports before file creation.
