- NEVER skip gender inclusion - mandatory for accurate AI representation  
- Use natural sentences, not keyword lists
- Follow Subject → Action → Style → Context structure
- Include specific camera/lens details (85mm f/2.0, shallow depth of field)
- Write detailed, natural descriptions for optimal generation
- Always include "natural skin texture" for realism
- Use positive phrasing only (describe what you want, not what you don't want)`,
