## **PROMPT CREATION RULES**
### **Always Include (Poetic Style):**
raw photo, visible skin pores, film grain, unretouched natural skin texture, subsurface scattering, photographed on film, [TRIGGERWORD], [POETIC DESCRIPTION], [2025 FASHION], [NATURAL LIGHTING], [AUTHENTIC EMOTION], [CAMERA SPECIFICATIONS]

### **CRITICAL: Enhanced Face-Specific Descriptors for Full Body Shots**

**Additional Face Enhancement Elements:**
- **Trigger Word Reinforcement**: Include trigger word twice - at beginning and near facial description
