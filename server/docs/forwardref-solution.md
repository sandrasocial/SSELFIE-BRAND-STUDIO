# ForwardRef Implementation Solution

## Overview
The final solution implements a direct window.forwardRef injection approach to resolve Vite JSX transform issues.

## Implementation Details

### Bundle Generation
- Generated bundle: `index-DhFVlUPY.js`
- Location: Production assets directory
- Implementation: Direct window.forwardRef injection

### Key Features
1. Global ForwardRef Availability
   - Bypasses Vite JSX transform issues
   - Makes forwardRef globally available
   - Injects directly into window object

2. Verification
   - Console messages confirm:
     - React global availability
     - ForwardRef injection success

### Technical Solution
```javascript
// Implementation approach
window.forwardRef = React.forwardRef;
```

### Verification Steps
1. Check browser console for injection messages
2. Verify React global availability
3. Confirm forwardRef functionality in components

### Benefits
- Resolves Vite JSX transformation issues
- Provides consistent forwardRef availability
- Eliminates runtime reference errors

### Production Implementation
- Bundle copied to production environment
- No additional configuration needed
- Direct integration with existing React setup

## Maintenance Notes
- Monitor for any React version updates
- Ensure bundle remains in sync with React updates
- Verify forwardRef availability after deployments
